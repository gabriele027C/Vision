Preface
B
y some estimates, quantitative or algorithmic trading now ac-
counts for over one-third of the trading volume in the United
States. There are, of course, innumerable books on the ad-
vanced mathematics and strategies utilized by institutional traders
in this arena. However, can an independent, retail trader beneﬁt
from these algorithms? Can an individual with limited resources and
computing power backtest and execute their strategies over thou-
sands of stocks, and come to challenge the powerful industry par-
ticipants in their own game?
I will show you how this can, in fact, be achieved.
WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?
I wrote this book with two types of readers in mind:
1. Aspiring independent (“retail”) traders who are looking to start
a quantitative trading business.
2. Students of ﬁnance or other technical disciplines (at the un-
dergraduate or MBA level) who aspire to become quantitative
traders and portfolio managers at major institutions.
Can these two very different groups of readers beneﬁt from the
same set of knowledge and skills? Is there anything common be-
tween managing a $100 million portfolio and managing a $100,000
portfolio? My contention is that it is much more logical and sen-
sible for someone to become a proﬁtable $100,000 trader before
xi

PREFACE
becoming a proﬁtable $100 million trader. This can be shown to be
true on many fronts.
Many legendary quantitative hedge fund managers such as Dr.
Edward Thorp of the former Princeton-Newport Partners (Pound-
stone, 2005) and Dr. Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies Corp.
(Lux, 2000) started their careers trading their own money. They did
not begin as portfolio managers for investment banks and hedge
funds before starting their own fund management business. Of
course, there are also plenty of counterexamples, but clearly this
is a possible route to riches as well as intellectual accomplishment,
and for someone with an entrepreneurial bent, a preferred route.
Even if your goal is to become an institutional trader, it is still
worthwhile to start your own trading business as a ﬁrst step. Physi-
cists and mathematicians are now swarming Wall Street. Few peo-
ple on the Street are impressed by a mere PhD from a prestigious
university anymore. What is the surest way to get through the door
of the top banks and funds? To show that you have a systematic
way to proﬁts—in other words, a track record. Quite apart from
serving as a stepping stone to a lucrative career in big institutions,
having a proﬁtable track record as an independent trader is an in-
valuable experience in itself. The experience forces you to focus on
simple but proﬁtable strategies, and not get sidetracked by overly
theoretical or sophisticated theories. It also forces you to focus
on the nitty-gritty of quantitative trading that you won’t learn from
most books: things such as how to build an order entry system that
doesn’t cost $10,000 of programming resource. Most importantly, it
forces you to focus on risk management—after all, your own per-
sonal bankruptcy is a possibility here. Finally, having been an insti-
tutional as well as a retail quantitative trader and strategist at differ-
ent times, I only wish that I had read a similar book before I started
my career at a bank—I would have achieved proﬁtability many
years sooner.
Given these preambles, I won’t make any further apologies in
the rest of the book in focusing on the entrepreneurial, indepen-
dent traders and how they can build a quantitative trading business
on their own, while hoping that many of the lessons would be useful
on their way to institutional money management as well.

WHAT KIND OF BACKGROUND DO YOU NEED?
Despite the scary-sounding title, you don’t need to be a math or
computer whiz in order to use this book as a guide to start trading
quantitatively. Yes, you do need to possess some basic knowledge
of statistics, such as how to calculate averages, standard deviations,
or how to ﬁt a straight line through a set of data points. Yes, you
also need to have some basic familiarity with Excel. But what you
don’t need is any advanced knowledge of stochastic calculus, neural
networks, or other impressive-sounding techniques.
Though it is true that you can make millions with nothing more
than Excel, it is also true that there is another tool that, if you are
proﬁcient at it, will enable you to backtest trading strategies much
more efﬁciently, and may also allow you to retrieve and process
data much more easily than you otherwise can. This tool is called
MATLAB®, and it is a mathematical platform that many institutional
quantitative strategists and portfolio managers use. Therefore, I will
demonstrate how to backtest the majority of strategies using MAT-
LAB. In fact, I have included a brief tutorial in the appendix on how
to do some basic programming in MATLAB. For many retail traders,
MATLAB is too expensive to purchase, but there are cheaper alter-
natives, which I will mention in Chapter 3 on backtesting. Further-
more, many university students can either purchase a cheaper stu-
dent MATLAB license or they already have free access to it through
their schools.
WHAT WILL YOU FIND IN THIS BOOK?
This book is deﬁnitely not designed as an encyclopedia of quantita-
tive trading techniques or terminologies. It will not even be about
speciﬁc proﬁtable strategies (although you can reﬁne the few ex-
ample strategies embedded here to make them quite proﬁtable.) In-
stead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy
yourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how
to reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical
performance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain


<!-- PAGE 16 -->

PREFACE
proﬁtable in the future. It teaches you a systematic way to scale up
or wind down your strategies depending on their real-life proﬁtabil-
ity. It teaches you some of the nuts and bolts of implementing an au-
tomated execution system in your own home. Finally, it teaches you
some basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-
vive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid
if you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.
Even though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy
should work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-
amples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical
arbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical
data on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on
backtesting, I did not include options because those are not in my
area of expertise.
The book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that
traders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-
ness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-
ter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has
good historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business
and technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated
trading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing
the money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this
strategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of
important advanced concepts with which most professional quan-
titative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with
reﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how
they can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that
contains a tutorial on using MATLAB.
You’ll see two different types of boxed material in this book:
r Sidebars containing an elaboration or illustration of a concept, and
r Examples, accompanied by MATLAB or Excel code.

uch of my knowledge and experiences in quantitative trad-
ing come from my colleagues and mentors at the var-
ious investment banks (Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse,
Maple Securities) and hedge funds (Mapleridge Capital, Millen-
nium Partners, MANE Fund Management), and I am very grate-
ful for their advice, guidance, and help over the years. Since I
became an independent trader and consultant, I have beneﬁted
enormously from discussions with my clients, readers of my blog,
fellow bloggers, and various trader-collaborators. In particular, I
would like to offer thanks to Steve Halpern and Ramon Cum-
mins for reading parts of the manuscript and correcting some
of the errors; to John Rigg for suggesting some of the topics
for my blog, many of which found their way into this book; to
Ashton Dorkins, editor-in-chief of tradingmarkets.com, who helped
syndicate my blog; and to Yaser Anwar for publicizing it to read-
ers of his own very popular investment blog. I am also indebted to
editor Bill Falloon at John Wiley & Sons for suggesting this book,
and to my development editor, Emilie Herman, and production ed-
itor Christina Verigan for seeing this book through to fruition. Last
but not least, I thank Ben Xie for insisting that simplicity is the best
policy.

The Whats,
Whos, and Whys
of Quantitative
Trading
I
f you are curious enough to pick up this book, you probably have
already heard of quantitative trading. But even for readers who
learned about this kind of trading from the mainstream media
before, it is worth clearing up some common misconceptions.
Quantitative trading, also known as algorithmic trading, is the
trading of securities based strictly on the buy/sell decisions of com-
puter algorithms. The computer algorithms are designed and per-
haps programmed by the traders themselves, based on the histor-
ical performance of the encoded strategy tested against historical
ﬁnancial data.
Is quantitative trading just a fancy name for technical analysis,
then? Granted, a strategy based on technical analysis can be part of
a quantitative trading system if it can be fully encoded as computer
programs. However, not all technical analysis can be regarded as
quantitative trading. For example, certain chartist techniques such
as “look for the formation of a head and shoulders pattern” might
not be included in a quantitative trader’s arsenal because they are
quite subjective and may not be quantiﬁable.
Yet quantitative trading includes more than just technical anal-
ysis. Many quantitative trading systems incorporate fundamental
data in their inputs: numbers such as revenue, cash ﬂow, debt-to-
equity ratio, and others. After all, fundamental data are nothing but
1

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
numbers, and computers can certainly crunch any numbers that are
fed into them! When it comes to judging the current ﬁnancial per-
formance of a company compared to its peers or compared to its
historical performance, the computer is often just as good as hu-
man ﬁnancial analysts—and the computer can watch thousands of
such companies all at once. Some advanced quantitative systems
can even incorporate news events as inputs: Nowadays, it is pos-
sible to use a computer to parse and understand the news report.
(After all, I used to be a researcher in this very ﬁeld at IBM, work-
ing on computer systems that can understand approximately what a
document is about.)
So you get the picture: As long as you can convert information
into bits and bytes that the computer can understand, it can be re-
garded as part of quantitative trading.
WHO CAN BECOME A
QUANTITATIVE TRADER?
It is true that most institutional quantitative traders received their
advanced degrees as physicists, mathematicians, engineers, or com-
puter scientists. This kind of training in the hard sciences is often
necessary when you want to analyze or trade complex derivative
instruments. But those instruments are not the focus in this book.
There is no law stating that one can become wealthy only by work-
ing with complicated ﬁnancial instruments. (In fact, one can become
quite poor trading complex mortgage-backed securities, as the ﬁnan-
cial crisis of 2007–08 and the demise of Bear Stearns have shown.)
The kind of quantitative trading I focus on is called statistical ar-
bitrage trading. Statistical arbitrage deals with the simplest ﬁnan-
cial instruments: stocks, futures, and sometimes currencies. One
does not need an advanced degree to become a statistical arbitrage
trader. If you have taken a few high school–level courses in math,
statistics, computer programming, or economics, you are probably
as qualiﬁed as anyone to tackle some of the basic statistical arbi-
trage strategies.


<!-- PAGE 25 -->

The Whats, Whos, and Whys of Quantitative Trading
3
Okay, you say, you don’t need an advanced degree, but surely
it gives you an edge in statistical arbitrage trading? Not necessarily.
I received a PhD from one of the top physics departments of the
world (Cornell’s). I worked as a successful researcher in one of the
top computer science research groups in the world (at that temple of
high-techdom: IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center). Then I worked
in a string of top investment banks and hedge funds as a researcher
and ﬁnally trader, including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and so
on. As a researcher and trader in these august institutions, I had al-
ways strived to use some of the advanced mathematical techniques
and training that I possessed and applied them to statistical arbi-
trage trading. Hundreds of millions of dollars of trades later, what
was the result? Losses, more losses, and losses as far as the eye can
see, for my employers and their investors. Finally, I quit the ﬁnan-
cial industry in frustration, set up a spare bedroom in my home as
my trading ofﬁce, and started to trade the simplest but still quan-
titative strategies I know. These are strategies that any smart high
school student can easily research and execute. For the ﬁrst time
in my life, my trading strategies became proﬁtable (one of which is
described in Example 3.6), and has been the case ever since. The
lesson I learned? As Einstein said: “Make everything as simple as
possible.” But not simpler.
(Stay tuned: I will detail more reasons why independent traders
can beat institutional money managers at their own game in
Chapter 8.)
Though I became a quantitative trader through a fairly tradi-
tional path, many others didn’t. Who are the typical independent
quantitative traders? Among people I know, they include a former
trader at a hedge fund that has gone out of business, a computer pro-
grammer who used to work for a brokerage, a former trader at one
of the exchanges, a former investment banker, a former biochemist,
and an architect. Some of them have received advanced technical
training, but others have only basic familiarity of high school–level
statistics. Most of them backtest their strategies using basic tools
like Excel, though others may hire programming contractors to help.
Most of them have at some point in their career been professionally
involved with the ﬁnancial world but have now decided that being


<!-- PAGE 26 -->

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
independent suits their needs better. As far as I know, most of them
are doing quite well on their own, while enjoying the enormous free-
dom that independence brings.
Besides having gained some knowledge of ﬁnance through their
former jobs, the fact that these traders have saved up a nest egg
for their independent venture is obviously important too. When one
plunges into independent trading, fear of losses and of being iso-
lated from the rest of the world is natural, and so it helps to have
both a prior appreciation of risks and some savings to lean on. It is
important not to have a need for immediate proﬁts to sustain your
daily living, as strategies have intrinsic rates of returns that cannot
be hurried (see Chapter 6).
Instead of fear, some of you are planning to trade because of
the love of thrill and danger, or an incredible self-conﬁdence that
instant wealth is imminent. This is also a dangerous emotion to bring
to independent quantitative trading. As I hope to persuade you in
this chapter and in the rest of the book, instant wealth is not the
objective of quantitative trading.
The ideal independent quantitative trader is therefore someone
who has some prior experience with ﬁnance or computer program-
ming, who has enough savings to withstand the inevitable losses and
periods without income, and whose emotion has found the right bal-
ance between fear and greed.
THE BUSINESS CASE FOR
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
A lot of us are in the business of quantitative trading because it is
exciting, intellectually stimulating, ﬁnancially rewarding, or perhaps
it is the only thing we are good at doing. But for others who may have
alternative skills and opportunities, it is worth pondering whether
quantitative trading is the best business for you.
Despite all the talk about untold hedge fund riches and dollars
that are measured in units of billions, in many ways starting a
quantitative trading business is very similar to starting any small
business. We need to start small, with limited investment (perhaps


<!-- PAGE 27 -->

The Whats, Whos, and Whys of Quantitative Trading
5
only a $50,000 initial investment), and gradually scale up the
business as we gain know-how and become proﬁtable.
In other ways, however, a quantitative trading business is very
different from other small businesses. Here are some of the most
important.
Scalability
Compared to most small businesses (other than certain dot-coms),
quantitative trading is very scalable (up to a point). It is easy to ﬁnd
yourselves trading millions of dollars in the comfort of your own
home, as long as your strategy is consistently proﬁtable. This is be-
cause scaling up often just means changing a number in your pro-
gram. This number is called leverage. You do not need to negotiate
with a banker or a venture capitalist to borrow more capital for your
business. The brokerages stand ready and willing to do that. If you
are a member of a proprietary trading ﬁrm (more on this later in
Chapter 4 on setting up a business), you may even be able to obtain
a leverage far exceeding that allowed by Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Regulation T. It is not unheard of for a propri-
etary trading ﬁrm to let you trade a portfolio worth $2 million in-
traday even if you have only $50,000 equity in your account (a ×40
leverage). At the same time, quantitative trading is deﬁnitely not a
get-rich-quick scheme. You should hope to have steadily increasing
proﬁts, but most likely it won’t be 200 percent a year, unlike starting
a dot-com or a software ﬁrm. In fact, as I will explain in Chapter 6
on money and risk management, it is dangerous to overleverage in
pursuit of overnight riches.
Demand on Time
Running most small businesses takes a lot of your time, at least
initially. Quantitative trading takes relatively little of your time. By
its very nature, quantitative trading is a highly automated business.
Sometimes, the more you manually interfere with the system and
override its decision, the worse it will perform. (Again, more on this
in Chapter 6.)


<!-- PAGE 28 -->

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
How much time you need to spend on day-to-day quantitative
trading depends very much on the degree of automation you have
achieved. For example, at a hedge fund I used to work for, some col-
leagues come into the ofﬁce only once a month. The rest of the time,
they just sit at home and occasionally remotely monitor their ofﬁce
computers, which are trading for them.
I consider myself to be in the middle of the pack in terms of au-
tomation. The largest block of time I need to spend is in the morning
before the market opens: I typically need to run various programs to
download and process the latest historical data, read company news
that comes up on my alert screen, run programs to generate the or-
ders for the day, and then launch a few baskets of orders before
the market opens and start a program that will launch orders auto-
matically throughout the day. I would also update my spreadsheet
to record the previous day’s proﬁt and loss (P&L) of the different
strategies I run based on the brokerages’ statements. All of this takes
about two hours.
After that, I spend another half hour near the market close to di-
rect the programs to exit various positions, manually checking that
those exit orders are correctly transmitted, and closing down vari-
ous automated programs properly.
In between market open and close, everything is supposed to be
on autopilot. Alas, the spirit is willing but the ﬂesh is weak: I often
cannot resist the urge to take a look (sometimes many looks) at
the intraday P&L of the various strategies on my trading screens. In
extreme situations, I might even be transﬁxed by the huge swings
in P&L and be tempted to intervene by manually exiting positions.
Fortunately, I have learned to better resist the temptation as time
goes on.
The urge to intervene manually is also strong when I have too
much time on my hands. Hence, instead of just staring at your trad-
ing screen, it is actually important to engage yourself in some other,
more healthful and enjoyable activities, such as going to the gym
during the trading day.
When I said quantitative trading takes little of your time, I am
referring to the operational side of the business. If you want to grow
your business, or keep your current proﬁts from declining due to


<!-- PAGE 29 -->

The Whats, Whos, and Whys of Quantitative Trading
7
increasing competition, you will need to spend time doing research
and backtesting on new strategies. But research and development of
new strategies is the creative part of any business, and it can be done
whenever you want to. So, between the market’s open and close, I
do my research; answer e-mails; chat with other traders, collabora-
tors, or clients; go to the gym; and so on. I do some of that work in
the evening and on weekends, too, but only when I feel like it—not
because I am obligated to.
When I generate more earnings, I will devote more software de-
velopment resources to further automate my process, so that the
programs can automatically start themselves up at the right time,
know how to download data automatically, maybe even know how
to interpret the news items that come across the newswire and take
appropriate actions, and shut themselves down automatically after
the market closes. When that day comes, the daily operation may
take no time at all, and it can run as it normally does even while I am
on vacation, as long as it can alert my mobile phone or a technical
support service when something goes wrong. In short, if you trea-
sure your leisure time or if you need time and ﬁnancial resources
to explore other businesses, quantitative trading is the business
for you.
The Nonnecessity of Marketing
Here is the biggest and most obvious difference between quantita-
tive trading and other small businesses. Marketing is crucial to most
small businesses—after all, you generate your revenue from other
people, who base their purchase decisions on things other than price
alone. In trading, your counterparties in the ﬁnancial marketplace
base their purchase decisions on nothing but the price. Unless you
are managing money for other people (which is beyond the scope of
this book), there is absolutely no marketing to do in a quantitative
trading business. This may seem obvious and trivial but is actually
an important difference, since the business of quantitative trading
allows you to focus exclusively on your product (the strategy and
the software), and not on anything that has to do with inﬂuencing
other people’s perception of yourself. To many people, this may

be the ultimate beauty of starting your own quantitative trading
business.
THE WAY FORWARD
If you are convinced that you want to become a quantitative trader,
a number of questions immediately follow: How do you ﬁnd the right
strategy to trade? How do you recognize a good versus a bad strat-
egy even before devoting any time to backtesting them? How do you
rigorously backtest them? If the backtest performance is good, what
steps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both
the business structure and the technological infrastructure? If the
strategy is proﬁtable in initial real-life trading, how does one scale
up the capital to make it into a growing income stream while manag-
ing the inevitable (but, hopefully, only occasional) losses that come
with trading? These nuts and bolts of quantitative trading will be
tackled in Chapters 2 through 6.
Though the list of processes to go through in order to get to the
ﬁnal destination of sustained and growing proﬁtability may seem
long and daunting, in reality it may be faster and easier than many
other businesses. When I ﬁrst started as an independent trader, it
took me only three months to ﬁnd and backtest my ﬁrst new strat-
egy, set up a new brokerage account with $100,000 capital, imple-
ment the execution system, and start trading the strategy. The strat-
egy immediately became proﬁtable in the ﬁrst month. Back in the
dot-com era, I started an Internet software ﬁrm. It took about 3 times
more investment, 5 times more human-power, and 24 times longer
to ﬁnd out that the business model didn’t work, whereupon all in-
vestors including myself lost 100 percent of their investments. Com-
pared to that experience, it really has been a breeze trading quanti-
tatively and proﬁtably.

Where Can We Find
Good Strategies?
T
his is the surprise: Finding a trading idea is actually not the
hardest part of building a quantitative trading business. There
are hundreds, if not thousands, of trading ideas that are in
the public sphere at any time, accessible to anyone at little or no
cost. Many authors of these trading ideas will tell you their com-
plete methodologies in addition to their backtest results. There are
ﬁnance and investment books, newspapers and magazines, main-
stream media web sites, academic papers available online or in the
nearest public library, trader forums, blogs, and on and on. Some of
the ones I ﬁnd valuable are listed in Table 2.1, but this is just a small
fraction of what is available out there.
In the past, because of my own academic bent, I regularly
perused the various preprints published by business school pro-
fessors or downloaded the latest online ﬁnance journal articles
to scan for good prospective strategies. In fact, the ﬁrst strategy
I traded when I became independent was based on such academic
research. (It was a version of the PEAD strategy referenced in
Chapter 7.) Increasingly, however, I have found that many strate-
gies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date
(perhaps the once-proﬁtable strategies have already lost their power
due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as
historical fundamental data). Furthermore, many of these academic

strategies work only on small-cap stocks, whose illiquidity may ren-
der actual trading proﬁts far less impressive than their backtests
would suggest.
This is not to say that you will not ﬁnd some gems if you are
persistent enough, but I have found that many traders’ forums or
blogs may suggest simpler strategies that are equally proﬁtable. You
might be skeptical that people would actually post truly proﬁtable
strategies in the public space for all to see. After all, doesn’t this
disclosure increase the competition and decrease the proﬁtability
of the strategy? And you would be right: Most ready-made strategies
that you may ﬁnd in these places actually do not withstand careful

backtesting. Just like the academic studies, the strategies from
traders’ forums may have worked only for a little while, or they
work for only a certain class of stocks, or they work only if you
don’t factor in transaction costs. However, the trick is that you
can often modify the basic strategy and make it proﬁtable. (Many
of these caveats as well as a few common variations on a basic
strategy will be examined in detail in Chapter 3.)
For example, someone once suggested a strategy to me that was
described in Wealth-Lab (see Table 2.1), where it was claimed that it
had a high Sharpe ratio. When I backtested the strategy, it turned out
not to work as well as advertised. I then tried a few simple modiﬁca-
tions, such as decreasing the holding period and entering and exiting
at different times than suggested, and was able to turn this strategy
into one of my main proﬁt centers. If you are diligent and creative
enough to try the multiple variations of a basic strategy, chances are
you will ﬁnd one of those variations that is highly proﬁtable.
When I left the institutional money management industry to
trade on my own, I worried that I would be cut off from the ﬂow
of trading ideas from my colleagues and mentors. But then I found
out that one of the best ways to gather and share trading ideas is
to start your own trading blog—for every trading “secret” that you
divulge to the world, you will be rewarded with multiple ones from
your readers. (The person who suggested the Wealth-Lab strategy to
me was a reader who works 12 time zones away. If it weren’t for my
blog, there was little chance that I would have met him and bene-
ﬁted from his suggestion.) In fact, what you thought of as secrets
are more often than not well-known ideas to many others! What
truly make a strategy proprietary and its secrets worth protecting
are the tricks and variations that you have come up with, not the
plain vanilla version.
Furthermore, your bad ideas will quickly get shot down by your
online commentators, thus potentially saving you from major losses.
After I glowingly described a seasonal stock-trading strategy on
my blog that was developed by some ﬁnance professors, a reader
promptly went ahead and backtested that strategy and reported that
it didn’t work. (See my blog entry, “Seasonal Trades in Stocks,”
at epchan.blogspot.com/2007/11/seasonal-trades-in-stocks.html and


<!-- PAGE 34 -->

the reader’s comment therein. This strategy is described in more de-
tail in Example 7.6.) Of course, I would not have traded this strategy
without backtesting it on my own anyway, and indeed, my subse-
quent backtest conﬁrmed his ﬁndings. But the fact that my reader
found signiﬁcant ﬂaws with the strategy is important conﬁrmation
that my own backtest is not erroneous.
All in all, I have found that it is actually easier to gather and
exchange trading ideas as an independent trader than when I was
working in the secretive hedge fund world in New York. (When I
worked at Millennium Partners—a multibillion-dollar hedge fund on
Fifth Avenue—one trader ripped a published paper out of the hands
of his programmer, who happened to have picked it up from the
trader’s desk. He was afraid the programmer might learn his “se-
crets.”) That may be because people are less wary of letting you
know their secrets when they think you won’t be obliterating their
proﬁts by allocating $100 million to that strategy.
No, the difﬁculty is not the lack of ideas. The difﬁculty is to de-
velop a taste for which strategy is suitable for your personal circum-
stances and goals, and which ones look viable even before you de-
vote the time to diligently backtest them. This taste for prospective
strategies is what I will try to convey in this chapter.
HOW TO IDENTIFY A STRATEGY THAT
SUITS YOU
Whether a strategy is viable often does not have anything to do with
the strategy itself—it has to do with you. Here are some considera-
tions.
Your Working Hours
Do you trade only part time? If so, you would probably want to con-
sider only strategies that hold overnight and not the intraday strate-
gies. Otherwise, you may have to fully automate your strategies (see
Chapter 5 on execution) so that they can run on autopilot most of
the time and alert you only when problems occur.


<!-- PAGE 35 -->

13
When I was working full time for others and trading part time
for myself, I traded a simple strategy in my personal account that
required entering or adjusting limit orders on a few exchange-traded
funds (ETFs) once a day, before the market opened. Then, when I
ﬁrst became independent, my level of automation was still relatively
low, so I considered only strategies that require entering orders once
before the market opens and once before the close. Later on, I added
a program that can automatically scan real-time market data and
transmit orders to my brokerage account throughout the trading day
when certain conditions are met. So trading remains a “part-time”
pursuit for me, which is partly why I want to trade quantitatively in
the ﬁrst place.
Your Programming Skills
Are you good at programming? If you know some programming
languages such as Visual Basic or even Java, C#, or C++, you can
explore high-frequency strategies, and you can also trade a large
number of securities. Otherwise, settle for strategies that trade only
once a day, or trade just a few stocks, futures, or currencies. (This
constraint may be overcome if you don’t mind the expense of hiring
a software contractor. Again, see Chapter 5 for more details.)
Your Trading Capital
Do you have a lot of capital for trading as well as expenditure on
infrastructure and operation? In general, I would not recommend
quantitative trading for an account with less than $50,000 capi-
tal. Let’s say the dividing line between a high- versus low-capital
account is $100,000. Capital availability affects many choices; the
ﬁrst is whether you should open a retail brokerage account or a
proprietary trading account (more on this in Chapter 4 on setting
up your business). For now, I will consider this constraint with
strategy choices in mind.
With a low-capital account, we need to ﬁnd strategies that can
utilize the maximum leverage available. (Of course, getting a higher
leverage is beneﬁcial only if you have a consistently proﬁtable


<!-- PAGE 36 -->

14
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
strategy.) Trading futures, currencies, and options can offer you
higher leverage than stocks; intraday positions allow a Regulation
T leverage of 4, while interday (overnight) positions allow only a
leverage of 2, requiring double the amount of capital for a portfo-
lio of the same size. Finally, capital (or leverage) availability de-
termines whether you should focus on directional trades (long or
short only) or dollar-neutral trades (hedged or pair trades). A dollar-
neutral portfolio (meaning the market value of the long positions
equals the market value of the short positions) or market-neutral
portfolio (meaning the beta of the portfolio with respect to a mar-
ket index is close to zero, where beta measures the ratio between
the expected returns of the portfolio and the expected returns of
the market index) require twice the capital or leverage of a long- or
short-only portfolio. So even though a hedged position is less risky
than an unhedged position, the returns generated are correspond-
ingly smaller and may not meet your personal requirements.
Capital availability also imposes a number of indirect con-
straints. It affects how much you can spend on various infrastruc-
ture, data, and software. For example, if you have low trading capi-
tal, your online brokerage will not be likely to supply you with real-
time market data for too many stocks, so you can’t really have a
strategy that requires real-time market data over a large universe of
stocks. (You can, of course, subscribe to a third-party market data
vendor, but then the extra cost may not be justiﬁable if your trad-
ing capital is low.) Similarly, clean historical stock data with high
frequency costs more than historical daily stock data, so a high-
frequency stock-trading strategy may not be feasible with small cap-
ital expenditure. For historical stock data, there is another quality
that may be even more important than their frequencies: whether
the data are free of survivorship bias. I will deﬁne survivorship bias
in the following section. Here, we just need to know that historical
stock data without survivorship bias are much more expensive than
those that have such a bias. Yet if your data have survivorship bias,
the backtest result can be unreliable.
The same consideration applies to news—whether you can af-
ford a high-coverage, real-time news source such as Bloomberg de-
termines whether a news-driven strategy is a viable one. Same for


<!-- PAGE 37 -->

15
fundamental (i.e., companies’ ﬁnancial) data—whether you can af-
ford a good historical database with fundamental data on companies
determines whether you can build a strategy that relies on such data.
Table 2.2 lists how capital (whether for trading or expenditure)
constraint can inﬂuence your many choices.
This table is, of course, not a set of hard-and-fast rules, just some
issues to consider. For example, if you have low capital but opened
an account at a proprietary trading ﬁrm, then you will be free of
many of the considerations above (though not expenditure on in-
frastructure). I started my life as an independent quantitative trader
with $100,000 at a retail brokerage account (I chose Interactive Bro-
kers), and I traded only directional, intraday stock strategies at ﬁrst.
But when I developed a strategy that sometimes requires much more
leverage in order to be proﬁtable, I signed up as a member of a pro-
prietary trading ﬁrm as well. (Yes, you can have both, or more, ac-
counts simultaneously. In fact, there are good reasons to do so if
only for the sake of comparing their execution speeds and access to
liquidity. See “Choosing a Brokerage or Proprietary Trading Firm”
in Chapter 4.)
Despite my frequent admonitions here and elsewhere to beware
of historical data with survivorship bias, when I ﬁrst started I down-
loaded only the split-and-dividend-adjusted Yahoo! Finance data

using the download program from HQuotes.com (more on the dif-
ferent databases and tools in Chapter 3). This database is not sur-
vivorship bias–free—but more than two years later, I am still using
it for most of my backtesting! In fact, a trader I know, who each
day trades more than 10 times my account size, typically uses such
biased data for his backtesting, and yet his strategies are still prof-
itable. How can this be possible? Probably because these are intra-
day strategies. It seems that the only people I know who are willing
and able to afford survivorship bias–free data are those who work in
money management ﬁrms trading tens of millions of dollars or more
(that includes my former self). So, you see, as long as you are aware
of the limitations of your tools and data, you can cut many corners
and still succeed.
Though futures afford you high leverage, some futures contracts
have such a large size that it would still be impossible for a small ac-
count to trade. For instance, though the platinum future contract on
the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) has a margin require-
ment of only $8,100, its nominal value is currently about $100,000.
Furthermore, its volatility is such that a 6 percent daily move is
not too rare, which translates to a $6,000 daily proﬁt-and-loss (P&L)
swing in your account due to just this one contract. (Believe me,
I used to have a few of these contracts in my account, and it is a
sickening feeling when they move against you.) In contrast, ES, the
E-mini S&P 500 future on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME,
soon to be merged with NYMEX), has a nominal value of about
$67,500, and a 6 percent or larger daily move happened only twice in
the last 15 years. That’s why its margin requirement is $4,500, only
55 percent that of the platinum contract.
Your Goal
Most people who choose to become traders want to earn a steady
(hopefully increasing) monthly, or at least quarterly, income. But
you may be independently wealthy, and long-term capital gain is all
that matters to you. The strategies to pursue for short-term income
versus long-term capital gain are distinguished mainly by their hold-
ing periods. Obviously, if you hold a stock for an average of one


<!-- PAGE 39 -->

Fishing for Ideas
17
year, you won’t be generating much monthly income (unless you
started trading a while ago and have launched a new subportfolio
every month, which you proceed to hold for a year—that is, you
stagger your portfolios.) More subtly, even if your strategy holds a
stock only for a month on average, your month-to-month proﬁt ﬂuc-
tuation is likely to be fairly large (unless you hold hundreds of dif-
ferent stocks in your portfolio, which can be a result of staggering
your portfolios), and therefore you cannot count on generating in-
come on a monthly basis. This relationship between holding period
(or, conversely, the trading frequency) and consistency of returns
(that is, the Sharpe ratio or, conversely, the drawdown) will be dis-
cussed further in the following section. The upshot here is that the
more regularly you want to realize proﬁts and generate income, the
shorter your holding period should be.
There is a misconception aired by some investment advisers,
though, that if your goal is to achieve maximum long-term capital
growth, then the best strategy is a buy-and-hold one. This notion
has been shown to be mathematically false. In reality, maximum
long-term growth is achieved by ﬁnding a strategy with the maxi-
mum Sharpe ratio (deﬁned in the next section), provided that you
have access to sufﬁciently high leverage. Therefore, comparing a
short-term strategy with a very short holding period, small annual
return, but very high Sharpe ratio, to a long-term strategy with a
long holding period, high annual return, but lower Sharpe ratio, it is
still preferable to choose the short-term strategy even if your goal is
long-term growth, barring tax considerations and the limitation on
your margin borrowing (more on this surprising fact later in Chapter
6 on money and risk management).
A TASTE FOR PLAUSIBLE STRATEGIES
AND THEIR PITFALLS
Now, let’s suppose that you have read about several potential strate-
gies that ﬁt your personal requirements. Presumably, someone else
has done backtests on these strategies and reported that they have
great historical returns. Before proceeding to devote your time to


<!-- PAGE 40 -->

18
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
performing a comprehensive backtest on this strategy (not to men-
tion devoting your capital to actually trading this strategy), there
are a number of quick checks you can do to make sure you won’t be
wasting your time or money.
How Does It Compare with a Benchmark and
How Consistent Are Its Returns?
This point seems obvious when the strategy in question is a stock-
trading strategy that buys (but not shorts) stocks. Everybody seems
to know that if a long-only strategy returns 10 percent a year, it is
not too fantastic because investing in an index fund will generate as
much, if not better, return on average. However, if the strategy is a
long-short dollar-neutral strategy (i.e., the portfolio holds long and
short positions with equal capital), then 10 percent is quite a good
return, because then the benchmark of comparison is not the market
index, but a riskless asset such as the yield of the three-month U.S.
Treasury bill (which at the time of this writing is about 4 percent).
Another issue to consider is the consistency of the returns gen-
erated by a strategy. Though a strategy may have the same average
return as the benchmark, perhaps it delivered positive returns every
month while the benchmark occasionally suffered some very bad
months. In this case, we would still deem the strategy superior. This
leads us to consider the information ratio or Sharpe ratio (Sharpe,
1994), rather than returns, as the proper performance measurement
of a quantitative trading strategy.
Information ratio is the measure to use when you want to assess
a long-only strategy. It is deﬁned as
Information Ratio =
Average of Excess Returns
Standard Deviation of Excess Returns
where
Excess Returns = Portfolio Returns −Benchmark Returns
Now the benchmark is usually the market index to which the
securities you are trading belong. For example, if you trade only


<!-- PAGE 41 -->

Fishing for Ideas
19
small-cap stocks, the market index should be the Standard & Poor’s
small-cap index or the Russell 2000 index, rather than the S&P 500.
If you are trading just gold futures, then the market index should be
gold spot price, rather than a stock index.
The Sharpe ratio is actually a special case of the information
ratio, suitable when we have a dollar-neutral strategy, so that the
benchmark to use is always the risk-free rate. In practice, most
traders use the Sharpe ratio even when they are trading a directional
(long or short only) strategy, simply because it facilitates compar-
ison across different strategies. Everyone agrees on what the risk-
free rate is, but each trader can use a different market index to come
up with their own favorite information ratio, rendering comparison
difﬁcult.
(Actually, there are some subtleties in calculating the Sharpe ra-
tio related to whether and how to subtract the risk-free rate, how to
annualize your Sharpe ratio for ease of comparison, and so on. I will
cover these subtleties in the next chapter, which will also contain
an example on how to compute the Sharpe ratio for a dollar-neutral
and a long-only strategy.)
If the Sharpe ratio is such a nice performance measure across
different strategies, you may wonder why it is not quoted more of-
ten instead of returns. In fact, when a colleague and I went to SAC
Capital Advisors (assets under management: $14 billion) to pitch a
strategy, their then head of risk management said to us: “Well, a high
Sharpe ratio is certainly nice, but if you can get a higher return in-
stead, we can all go buy bigger houses with our bonuses!” This rea-
soning is quite wrong: A higher Sharpe ratio will actually allow you
to make more proﬁts in the end, since it allows you to trade at a
higher leverage. It is the leveraged return that matters in the end,
not the nominal return of a trading strategy. For more on this, see
Chapter 6 on money and risk management.
(And no, our pitching to SAC was not successful, but for rea-
sons quite unrelated to the returns of the strategy. In any case,
at that time neither my colleague nor I were familiar enough with
the mathematical connection between the Sharpe ratio and lever-
aged returns to make a proper counterargument to that head of risk
management.)


<!-- PAGE 42 -->

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Now that you know what a Sharpe ratio is, you may want to
ﬁnd out what kind of Sharpe ratio your candidate strategies have.
Often, they are not reported by the authors of that strategy, and you
will have to e-mail them in private for this detail. And often, they
will oblige, especially if the authors are ﬁnance professors; but if
they refuse, you have no choice but to perform the backtest yourself.
Sometimes, however, you can still make an educated guess based on
the ﬂimsiest of information:
r If a strategy trades only a few times a year, chances are its
Sharpe ratio won’t be high. This does not prevent it from being
part of your multistrategy trading business, but it does disqualify
the strategy from being your main proﬁt center.
r If a strategy has deep (e.g., more than 10 percent) or lengthy
(e.g., four or more months) drawdowns, it is unlikely that it will
have a high Sharpe ratio. I will explain the concept of drawdown
in the next section, but you can just visually inspect the equity
curve (which is also the cumulative proﬁt-and-loss curve, assum-
ing no redemption or cash infusion) to see if it is very bumpy
or not. Any peak-to-trough of that curve is a drawdown. (See
Figure 2.1 for an example.)

As a rule of thumb, any strategy that has a Sharpe ratio of less
than 1 is not suitable as a stand-alone strategy. For a strategy that
achieves proﬁtability almost every month, its (annualized) Sharpe
ratio is typically greater than 2. For a strategy that is proﬁtable al-
most every day, its Sharpe ratio is usually greater than 3. I will show
you how to calculate Sharpe ratios for various strategies in Exam-
ples 3.4, 3.6, and 3.7 in the next chapter.
How Deep and Long Is the Drawdown?
A strategy suffers a drawdown whenever it has lost money recently.
A drawdown at a given time t is deﬁned as the difference between
the current equity value (assuming no redemption or cash infusion)
of the portfolio and the global maximum of the equity curve occur-
ring on or before time t. The maximum drawdown is the difference
between the global maximum of the equity curve with the global
minimum of the curve after the occurrence of the global maximum
(time order matters here: The global minimum must occur later
than the global maximum). The global maximum is called the “high
watermark.” The maximum drawdown duration is the longest it
has taken for the equity curve to recover losses.
More often, drawdowns are measured in percentage terms, with
the denominator being the equity at the high watermark, and the nu-
merator being the loss of equity since reaching the high watermark.
Figure 2.1 illustrates a typical drawdown, the maximum draw-
down, and the maximum drawdown duration of an equity curve.
I will include a tutorial in Example 3.5 on how to compute these
quantities from a table of daily proﬁts and losses using either Excel
or MATLAB. One thing to keep in mind: The maximum drawdown
and the maximum drawdown duration do not typically overlap over
the same period.
Deﬁned mathematically, drawdown seems abstract and remote.
However, in real life there is nothing more gut-wrenching and
emotionally disturbing to suffer than a drawdown if you’re a trader.
(This is as true for independent traders as for institutional ones.
When an institutional trading group is suffering a drawdown, every-
body seems to feel that life has lost meaning and spend their days

dreading the eventual shutdown of the strategy or maybe even the
group as a whole.) It is therefore something we would want to mini-
mize. You have to ask yourself, realistically, how deep and how long
a drawdown will you be able to tolerate and not liquidate your port-
folio and shut down your strategy? Would it be 20 percent and three
months, or 10 percent and one month? Comparing your tolerance
with the numbers obtained from the backtest of a candidate strat-
egy determines whether that strategy is for you.
Even if the author of the strategy you read about did not pub-
lish the precise numbers for drawdowns, you should still be able to
make an estimate from a graph of its equity curve. For example, in
Figure 2.1, you can see that the longest drawdown goes from around
February 2001 to around October 2002. So the maximum drawdown
duration is about 20 months. Also, at the beginning of the maximum
drawdown, the equity was about $2.3 × 104, and at the end, about
$0.5 × 104. So the maximum drawdown is about $1.8 × 104.
How Will Transaction Costs Affect the Strategy?
Every time a strategy buys and sells a security, it incurs a trans-
action cost. The more frequent it trades, the larger the impact of
transaction costs will be on the proﬁtability of the strategy. These
transaction costs are not just due to commission fees charged by
the broker. There will also be the cost of liquidity—when you buy
and sell securities at their market prices, you are paying the bid-ask
spread. If you buy and sell securities using limit orders, however,
you avoid the liquidity costs but incur opportunity costs. This is be-
cause your limit orders may not be executed, and therefore you may
miss out on the potential proﬁts of your trade. Also, when you buy
or sell a large chunk of securities, you will not be able to complete
the transaction without impacting the prices at which this transac-
tion is done. (Sometimes just displaying a bid to buy a large number
of shares for a stock can move the prices higher without your having
bought a single share yet!) This effect on the market prices due to
your own order is called market impact, and it can contribute to a
large part of the total transaction cost when the security is not very
liquid.


<!-- PAGE 45 -->

23
Finally, there can be a delay between the time your program
transmits an order to your brokerage and the time it is executed
at the exchange, due to delays on the Internet or various software-
related issues. This delay can cause a “slippage,” the difference be-
tween the price that triggers the order and the execution price. Of
course, this slippage can be of either sign, but on average it will be
a cost rather than a gain to the trader. (If you ﬁnd that it is a gain on
average, you should change your program to deliberately delay the
transmission of the order by a few seconds!)
Transaction costs vary widely for different kinds of securities.
You can typically estimate it by taking half the average bid-ask
spread of a security and then adding the commission if your or-
der size is not much bigger than the average sizes of the best bid
and offer. If you are trading S&P 500 stocks, for example, the aver-
age transaction cost (excluding commissions, which depend on your
brokerage) would be about 5 basis points (that is, ﬁve-hundredths of
a percent). Note that I count a round-trip transaction of a buy and
then a sell as two transactions—hence, a round trip will cost 10 ba-
sis points in this example. If you are trading ES, the E-mini S&P 500
futures, the transaction cost will be about 1 basis point. Sometimes
the authors whose strategies you read about will disclose that they
have included transaction costs in their backtest performance, but
more often they will not. If they haven’t, then you just to have to
assume that the results are before transactions, and apply your own
judgment to its validity.
As an example of the impact of transaction costs on a strategy,
consider this simple mean-reverting strategy on ES. It is based on
Bollinger bands: that is, every time the price exceeds plus or minus
2 moving standard deviations of its moving average, short or buy, re-
spectively. Exit the position when the price reverts back to within 1
moving standard deviation of the moving average. If you allow your-
self to enter and exit every ﬁve minutes, you will ﬁnd that the Sharpe
ratio is about 3 without transaction costs—very excellent indeed!
Unfortunately, the Sharpe ratio is reduced to –3 if we subtract 1 ba-
sis point as transaction costs, making it a very unproﬁtable strategy.
For another example of the impact of transaction costs, see
Example 3.7.

Does the Data Suffer from Survivorship Bias?
A historical database of stock prices that does not include stocks
that have disappeared due to bankruptcies, delistings, mergers, or
acquisitions suffer from the so-called survivorship bias, because
only “survivors” of those often unpleasant events remain in the
database. (The same term can be applied to mutual fund or hedge
fund databases that do not include funds that went out of business.)
Backtesting a strategy using data with survivorship bias can be dan-
gerous because it may inﬂate the historical performance of the strat-
egy. This is especially true if the strategy has a “value” bent; that is,
it tends to buy stocks that are cheap. Some stocks were cheap be-
cause the companies were going bankrupt shortly. So if your strat-
egy includes only those cases when the stocks were very cheap
but eventually survived (and maybe prospered) and neglects those
cases where the stocks ﬁnally did get delisted, the backtest perfor-
mance will, of course, be much better than what a trader would ac-
tually have suffered at that time.
So when you read about a “buy on the cheap” strategy that has
great performance, ask the author of that strategy whether it was
tested on survivorship bias–free (sometimes called “point-in-time”)
data. If not, be skeptical of its results. (A toy strategy that illustrates
this can be found in Example 3.3.)
How Did the Performance of the Strategy
Change over the Years?
Most strategies performed much better 10 years ago than now, at
least in a backtest. There weren’t as many hedge funds running
quantitative strategies then. Also, bid-ask spreads were much wider
then: So if you assumed the transaction cost today was applicable
throughout the backtest, the earlier period would have unrealisti-
cally high returns.
Survivorship bias in the data might also contribute to the good
performance in the early period. The reason that survivorship bias
mainly inﬂates the performance of an earlier period is that the fur-
ther back we go in our backtest, the more missing stocks we will


<!-- PAGE 47 -->

25
have. Since some of those stocks are missing because they went
out of business, a long-only strategy would have looked better in
the early period of the backtest than what the actual proﬁt and loss
(P&L) would have been at that time. Therefore, when judging the
suitability of a strategy, one must pay particular attention to its per-
formance in the most recent few years, and not be fooled by the
overall performance, which inevitably includes some rosy numbers
back in the old days.
Finally, “regime shifts” in the ﬁnancial markets can mean that
ﬁnancial data from an earlier period simply cannot be ﬁtted to the
same model that is applicable today. Major regime shifts can oc-
cur because of changes in securities market regulation (such as
decimalization of stock prices or the elimination of the short-sale
rule, which I allude to in Chapter 5) or other macroeconomic events
(such as the subprime mortgage meltdown).
This point may be hard to swallow for many statistically minded
readers. Many of them may think that the more data there is, the
more statistically robust the backtest should be. This is true only
when the ﬁnancial time series is generated by a stationary process.
Unfortunately, ﬁnancial time series is famously nonstationary, due
to all of the reasons given earlier.
It is possible to incorporate such regime shifts into a sophisti-
cated “super”-model (as I will discuss in Example 7.1), but it is much
simpler if we just demand that our model deliver good performance
on recent data.
Does the Strategy Suffer from
Data-Snooping Bias?
If you build a trading strategy that has 100 parameters, it is very
likely that you can optimize those parameters in such a way that
the historical performance will look fantastic. It is also very likely
that the future performance of this strategy will look nothing like
its historical performance and will turn out to be very poor. By hav-
ing so many parameters, you are probably ﬁtting the model to his-
torical accidents in the past that will not repeat themselves in the


<!-- PAGE 48 -->

26
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
future. Actually, this so-called data-snooping bias is very hard to
avoid even if you have just one or two parameters (such as entry and
exit thresholds), and I will leave the discussion on how to minimize
its impact to Chapter 3. But, in general, the more rules the strategy
has, and the more parameters the model has, the more likely it is go-
ing to suffer data-snooping bias. Simple models are often the ones
that will stand the test of time. (See the sidebar on my views on
artiﬁcial intelligence and stock picking.)

There was an article in the New York Times a short while ago about a new hedge
fund launched by Mr. Ray Kurzweil, a pioneer in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence.
(Thanks to my fellow blogger, Yaser Anwar, who pointed it out to me.) According
to Kurzweil, the stock-picking decisions in this fund are supposed to be made
by machines that “. . . can observe billions of market transactions to see patterns
we could never see” (quoted in Duhigg, 2006).
While I am certainly a believer in algorithmic trading, I have become a skep-
tic when it comes to trading based on “artiﬁcial intelligence.”
At the risk of oversimpliﬁcation, we can characterize artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI) as trying to ﬁt past data points into a function with many, many param-
eters. This is the case for some of the favorite tools of AI: neural networks,
decision trees, and genetic algorithms. With many parameters, we can for sure
capture small patterns that no human can see. But do these patterns persist?
Or are they random noises that will never replay again? Experts in AI assure
us that they have many safeguards against ﬁtting the function to transient
noise. And indeed, such tools have been very eﬀective in consumer market-
ing and credit card fraud detection. Apparently, the patterns of consumers and
thefts are quite consistent over time, allowing such AI algorithms to work even
with a large number of parameters. However, from my experience, these safe-
guards work far less well in ﬁnancial markets prediction, and overﬁtting to
the noise in historical data remains a rampant problem. As a matter of fact,
I have built ﬁnancial predictive models based on many of these AI algorithms in
the past. Every time a carefully constructed model that seems to work marvels
in backtest came up, they inevitably performed miserably going forward. The
main reason for this seems to be that the amount of statistically independent
ﬁnancial data is far more limited compared to the billions of independent con-
sumer and credit transactions available. (You may think that there is a lot of tick-
by-tick ﬁnancial data to mine, but such data is serially correlated and far from
independent.)


<!-- PAGE 49 -->

This is not to say that no methods based on AI will work in prediction. The
ones that work for me are usually characterized by these properties:
r They are based on a sound econometric or rational basis, and not on ran-
dom discovery of patterns.
r They have few parameters that need to be ﬁtted to past data.
r They involve linear regression only, and not ﬁtting to some esoteric non-
linear functions.
r They are conceptually simple.
r All optimizations must occur in a lookback moving window, involving no fu-
ture unseen data. And the eﬀect of this optimization must be continuously
demonstrated using this future, unseen data.
Only when a trading model is constrained in such a manner do I dare to
allow testing on my small, precious amount of historical data. Apparently, Oc-
cam’s razor works not only in science, but in ﬁnance as well.

Does the Strategy “Fly under the Radar”
of Institutional Money Managers?
Since this book is about starting a quantitative trading business from
scratch, and not about starting a hedge fund that manages multiple
millions of dollars, we should not be concerned whether a strategy
is one that can absorb multiple millions of dollars. (Capacity is the
technical term for how much a strategy can absorb without nega-
tively impacting its returns.) In fact, quite the opposite—you should
look for those strategies that ﬂy under the radar of most institutional
investors, for example, strategies that have very low capacities be-
cause they trade too often, strategies that trade very few stocks ev-
ery day, or strategies that have very infrequent positions (such as
some seasonal trades in commodity futures described in Chapter 7).
Those niches are the ones that are likely still to be proﬁtable because
they have not yet been completely arbitraged away by the gigantic
hedge funds.

SUMMARY
Finding prospective quantitative trading strategies is not difﬁcult.
There are:
r Business school and other economic research web sites.
r Financial web sites and blogs focusing on the retail investors.
r Trader forums where you can exchange ideas with fellow
traders.
After you have done a sufﬁcient amount of Net surﬁng or trading
magazine rifﬂing, you will ﬁnd a number of promising trading strate-
gies. Whittle them down to just a handful based on your personal
circumstances and requirements, and by applying the screening cri-
teria (more accurately described as healthy skepticism) that I listed
earlier:
r How much time do you have for baby-sitting your trading pro-
grams?
r How good a programmer are you?
r How much capital do you have?
r Is your goal to earn steady monthly income or to strive for a
large, long-term capital gain?
Even before doing an in-depth backtest of the strategy, you can
quickly ﬁlter out some unsuitable strategies if they fail one or more
of these tests:
r Does it outperform a benchmark?
r Does it have a high enough Sharpe ratio?
r Does it have a small enough drawdown and short enough draw-
down duration?
r Does the backtest suffer from survivorship bias?
r Does the strategy lose steam in recent years compared to its ear-
lier years?


<!-- PAGE 51 -->

Fishing for Ideas
29
r Does the strategy have its own “niche” that protects it from in-
tense competition from large institutional money managers?
After making all these quick judgments, you are now ready to
proceed to the next chapter, which is to rigorously backtest the
strategy yourself to make sure that it does what it is advertised
to do.


<!-- PAGE 53 -->

C H A P T E R 3
Backtesting
A key difference between a traditional investment management pro-
cess and a quantitative investment process is the possibility of back-
testing a quantitative investment strategy to see how it would have
performed in the past. Even if you found a strategy described in
complete detail with all the historical performance data available,
you would still need to backtest it yourself. This exercise serves
several purposes. If nothing else, this replication of the research will
ensure that you have understood the strategy completely and have
reproduced it exactly for implementation as a trading system. Just
as in any medical or scientiﬁc research, replicating others’ results
also ensures that the original research did not commit any of the
common errors plaguing this process. But more than just perform-
ing due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-
iment with variations of the original strategy, thereby reﬁning and
improving the strategy.
In this chapter, I will describe the common platforms that can
be used for backtesting, various sources of historical data useful for
backtesting, a minimal set of standard performance measures that a
backtest should provide, common pitfalls to avoid, and simple re-
ﬁnements and improvements to strategies. A few fully developed
backtesting examples will also be presented to illustrate the prin-
ciples and techniques described.

COMMON BACKTESTING PLATFORMS
There are numerous commercial platforms that are designed for
backtesting, some of them costing tens of thousands of dollars. In
keeping with the focus on start-ups in this book, I start with those
with which I am familiar and that can be purchased economically
and are widely used.
Excel
This is the most basic and most common tool for traders, whether
retail or institutional. You can enhance its power further if you can
write Visual Basic macros. The beauty of Excel is “What you see
is what you get” (or WYSIWYG in computing parlance). Data and
program are all in one place so that nothing is hidden. Also, a com-
mon backtesting pitfall called “look-ahead bias,” which will be ex-
plained later, is unlikely to occur in Excel (unless you use macros,
which renders it no longer WYSIWYG) because you can easily align
the dates with the various data columns and signals on a spread-
sheet. Another advantage of Excel is that often backtesting and live
trade generation can be done from the same spreadsheet, eliminat-
ing any duplication of programming efforts. The major disadvantage
of Excel is that it can be used to backtest only fairly simple models.
But, as I explained in the previous chapter, simple models are often
the best!
MATLAB
MATLAB R⃝(www.mathworks.com) is one of the most common
backtesting platforms used by quantitative analysts and traders in
large institutions. It is ideal for testing strategies that involve a
large portfolio of stocks. (Imagine backtesting a strategy involving
1,500 symbols on Excel—it is possible, but quite painful.). It has nu-
merous advanced statistical and mathematical modules built in, so
traders do not have to reinvent the wheel if their trading algorithms
involve some sophisticated but common mathematical concepts.


<!-- PAGE 55 -->

Backtesting
33
(A good example is principal component analysis—often used in
factor models in statistical arbitrage trading, and a hassle to im-
plement in other programming languages. See Example 7.4.) There
is also a large number of third-party freeware available for down-
load from the Internet, many of them very useful for quantitative
trading purposes (an example is the cointegration package used in
Example 7.2). Finally, MATLAB is very useful in retrieving web
pages with ﬁnancial information and parsing it into a useful form
(so-called web scraping). Example 3.1 shows how this can be done.
Despite the seeming sophistication of the platform, it is actually
very easy to learn (at least for basic usage) and it is very quick to
write a complete backtest program using this language. The main
drawback of MATLAB is that it is relatively expensive: it costs over
$1,000 to acquire a license. However, there are several clones of
MATLAB on the market where you can write and use codes that
are very similar to MATLAB:
r O-Matrix (www.omatrix.com)
r Octave (www.gnu.org/software/octave)
r Scilab (www.scilab.org)
These clones may cost only several hundred dollars, or may be
entirely free. Not surprisingly, the more expensive the clone is, the
more compatible it is with programs written in MATLAB. (Of course,
if you intend to write all the programs yourself and not use any third
party’s codes, compatibility is not an issue. But then you would be
forfeiting one of the main beneﬁts of using this language.) The other
drawback of MATLAB is that it is very useful for backtesting but
clumsy to use as an execution platform. So, often, you will need
to build a separate execution system in another language once you
have backtested your strategy. Despite these drawbacks, MATLAB
has found widespread use within the quantitative trading commu-
nity. I will include MATLAB codes for all the backtesting examples
in this book as well as provide a quick survey of the MATLAB lan-
guage itself in the appendix.

Example 3.1: Using MATLAB to Scrape Web Pages

MATLAB is not only useful for numerical computations, but also for text

historical price information from Yahoo! Finance:
clear; % make sure previously defined variables are
%erased.
symbol=‘IBM’; % the stock of interest

% extracting the numbers field to a cell array of cells

one limitation to this web-scraping script: It can retrieve only one web page

not really useful for retrieving the entire price history of IBM. Nevertheless,
it is a simple illustration of MATLAB’s text processing functions.

TradeStation
TradeStation (www.tradestation.com) is familiar to many retail
traders as a brokerage that provides all-in-one backtesting and trade
execution platforms linked to the brokerage’s servers. The main ad-
vantages of this setup are:
r Most of the historical data necessary for backtesting is readily
available, whereas you have to download the data from some-
where else if you use Excel or MATLAB.
r Once you have backtested the program, you can immediately
generate orders using the same program and transmit them to
the brokerage.
The disadvantages of this approach are that once you have writ-
ten the software for your strategy, you are tied to TradeStation as
your broker, and the proprietary language used by TradeStation is
not as ﬂexible as MATLAB and does not include some of the more
advanced statistical and mathematical functions some traders use.
Nevertheless, if you prefer the ease of use of an all-in-one system,
TradeStation may be a good choice.
Since I have not used TradeStation in my own work, I will not
include backtesting examples in TradeStation.
High-End Backtesting Platforms
In case you do have the ﬁnancial resources to purchase a high-end,
institutional-grade backtesting platform, here is a partial list:

aegis)
r Logical Information Machines (www.lim.com)
r Alphacet’s Discovery (www.alphacet.com)


<!-- PAGE 58 -->

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Of all these, I have personal experience with only Logical In-
formation Machines and Alphacet Discovery. Logical Information
Machines is excellent for testing futures trading strategies, but it is
weaker for equities strategies, based on my experience 10 years ago.
Alphacet Discovery is a new product that integrates data retrieval,
backtesting, optimization with machine learning algorithms, and au-
tomated execution. It is quite powerful for backtesting and trading a
range of markets including futures, equities, and currencies. Exam-
ple 7.1 is a backtest example using the Discovery platform.
FINDING AND USING HISTORICAL
DATABASES
If you have a strategy in mind that requires a speciﬁc type of his-
torical data, the ﬁrst thing to do is to Google that type of data. You
will be surprised how many free or low-cost historical databases
are available out there for many types of data. (For example, try
the search phrase “free historical intraday futures data.”) Table 3.1
includes a number of the databases that I have found useful over
the years, most of them either free or very low cost. I have deliber-
ately left out the expensive databases from Bloomberg, Dow Jones,
FactSet, Thomson Reuters, or Tick Data. Though they have almost
every type of data imaginable for purchase, these data vendors cater
mostly to more established institutions and are typically not in the
price range of individuals or start-up institutions.
While ﬁnding sources of data on the Internet is even easier than
ﬁnding prospective strategies, there are a number of issues and pit-
falls with many of these databases that I will discuss later in this sec-
tion. These issues apply mostly to stock and exchange-traded fund
(ETF) data only. Here are the most important ones.

called a reverse split) with an ex-date of T, all the prices before T
need to be multiplied by 1/N. Similarly, when a company issued a
dividend $d per share with an ex-date of T, all the prices before T
need to be multiplied by the number (Close(T – 1) – d)/Close(T –
1), where Close(T – 1) is the closing price of the trading day before
T. Notice that I adjust the historical prices by a multiplier instead
of subtracting $d so that the historical daily returns will remain the
same pre- and postadjustment. This is the way Yahoo! Finance ad-
justs its historical data, and is the most common way. (If you adjust
by subtracting $d instead, the historical daily changes in prices will
be the same pre- and postadjustment, but not the daily returns.) If
the historical data are not adjusted, you will ﬁnd a drop in price
at the ex-date’s market open from previous day’s close (apart from
normal market ﬂuctuation), which may trigger an erroneous trading
signal.
I recommend getting historical data that are already split and
dividend adjusted, because otherwise you would have to ﬁnd a
separate historical database (such as earnings.com) of splits and
dividends and apply the adjustments yourself—a somewhat te-
dious and error-prone task, which I will describe in the following
example.
Example 3.2: Adjusting for Splits and Dividends
Here we look at IGE, an ETF that has had both splits and dividends in its
history. It had a 2:1 split on June 9, 2005 (the ex-date). Let’s look at the
unadjusted prices around that date (you can download the historical prices
of IGE from Yahoo! Finance into an Excel spreadsheet):

We need to adjust the prices prior to 6/9/2005 due to this split. This
is easy: N = 2 here, and all we need to do is to multiply those prices by 1
2.
The following table shows the adjusted prices:

Now, the astute reader will notice that the adjusted close prices here
do not match the adjusted close prices displayed in the Yahoo! Finance
table. The reason for this is that there have been dividends distributed af-
ter 6/9/2005, so the Yahoo! prices have been adjusted for all those as
well. Since each adjustment is a multiplier, the aggregate adjustment is
just the product of all the individual multipliers. Here are the dividends
from 6/9/2005 to November 2007, together with the unadjusted closing
prices of the previous trading days and the resulting individual multipliers:

(Check out the multipliers yourself on Excel using the formula I gave
above to see if they agree with my values here.) So the aggregate multi-
plier for the dividends is simply 0.998618 × 0.997488 × · · · × 0.997214 =
0.976773. This multiplier should be applied to all the unadjusted prices
on or after 6/9/2005. The aggregate multiplier for the dividends and the
split is 0.976773 × 0.5 = 0.488386, which should be applied to all the

You can see that the adjusted closing prices from our calculations and
from Yahoo! are the same (after rounding to two decimal places). But, of
course, when you are reading this, IGE will likely have distributed more
dividends and may have even split further, so your Yahoo! table won’t look
like the one above. It is a good exercise to check that you can make further
adjustments based on those dividends and splits that result in the same
adjusted prices as your current Yahoo! table.
Are the Data Survivorship Bias Free?
We already covered this issue in Chapter 2. Unfortunately, databases
that are free from survivorship bias are quite expensive and may
not be affordable for a start-up business. One way to overcome this
problem is to start collecting point-in-time data yourself for the ben-
eﬁt of your future backtest. If you save the prices each day of all the
stocks in your universe to a ﬁle, then you will have a point-in-time
or survivorship-bias-free database to use in the future. Another way
to lessen the impact of survivorship bias is to backtest your strate-
gies on more recent data so that the results are not distorted by too
many missing stocks.

Example 3.3: An Example of How Survivorship Bias Can
Artiﬁcially Inﬂate a Strategy’s Performance
Here is a toy “buy low-price stocks” strategy (Warning: This toy strategy is
hazardous to your ﬁnancial health!). Let’s say from a universe of the 1,000
largest stocks (based on market capitalization), we pick 10 that have the
lowest closing prices at the beginning of the year and hold them (with equal
initial capital) for one year. Let’s look at what we would have picked if we
had a good, survivorship-bias-free database:

All but MDM were delisted sometime between 1/2/2001 and 1/2/2002
(after all, the dot-com bubble was seriously bursting then!). The NaNs indi-
cate those with nonexistent closing prices on 1/2/2002. The Terminal Price
column indicates the last prices at which the stocks were traded on or before
1/2/2002. The total return on this portfolio in that year was –42 percent.
Now, let’s look at what we would have picked if our database had sur-
vivorship bias and actually missed all those stocks that were delisted that
year. We would then have picked the following list instead:

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Notice that since we select only those stocks that “survived” until at
least 1/2/2002, they all have closing prices on that day. The total return on
this portfolio was 388 percent!
In this example, –42 percent was the actual return a trader would ex-
perience following this strategy, whereas 388 percent is a ﬁctitious return
that was due to survivorship bias in our database.
Does Your Strategy Use High and Low Data?
For almost all daily stock data, the high and low prices are far noisier
than the open and close prices. What this means is that even when
you had placed a buy limit order below the recorded high of a day, it
might not have been ﬁlled, and vice versa for a sell limit order. (This
could be due to the fact that a very small order was transacted at the
high, or the execution could have occurred on a market to which
your order was not routed. Sometimes, the high or low is simply
due to an incorrectly reported tick that was not ﬁltered out.) Hence,
a backtest that relies on high and low data is less reliable than one
that relies on the open and close.
Actually, sometimes even a market on open (MOO) or market
on close (MOC) order might not be ﬁlled at the historical open
and close prices shown in your data. This is due to the fact that
the historical prices shown may be due to the primary exchange
(e.g., New York Stock Exchange [NYSE]), or it may be a composite
price including all the regional exchanges. Depending on where your
order was routed, it may be ﬁlled at a different price from the his-
torical opening or closing price shown in your dataset. Neverthe-
less, the discrepancies of the open and close prices usually have
less impact on backtest performance than the errors in the high
and low prices, since the latter almost always inﬂate your backtest
returns.
After retrieving the data from a database, it is often advisable to
do a quick error check. The simplest way to do this is to calculate
the daily returns based on the data. If you have open, high, low, and
close prices, you can calculate the various combinations of daily
returns such as from the previous high to today’s close as well. You


<!-- PAGE 65 -->

43
can then examine closely those days with returns that are, say, 4
standard deviations away from the average. Typically, an extreme
return should be accompanied by a news announcement, or should
occur on a day when the market index also experienced extreme
returns. If not, then your data is suspect.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Quantitative traders use a good variety of performance measures.
Which set of numbers to use is sometimes a matter of personal pref-
erence, but with ease of comparisons across different strategies and
traders in mind, I would argue that the Sharpe ratio and drawdowns
are the two most important. Notice that I did not include average an-
nualized returns, the measure most commonly quoted by investors,
because if you use this measure, you have to tell people a number
of things about what denominator you use to calculate returns. For
example, in a long-short strategy, did you use just one side of capital
or both sides in the denominator? Is the return a leveraged one (the
denominator is based on account equity), or is it unleveraged (the
denominator is based on market value of the portfolio)? If the equity
or market value changes daily, do you use a moving average as the
denominator, or just the value at the end of each day or each month?
Most (but not all) of these problems associated with comparing re-
turns can be avoided by quoting Sharpe ratio and drawdown instead
as the standard performance measures.
I introduced the concepts of the Sharpe ratio, maximum draw-
down, and maximum drawdown duration in Chapter 2. Here, I will
just note a number of subtleties associated with calculating the
Sharpe ratio, and give some computational examples in both Excel
and MATLAB.
There is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned port-
folio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or
shouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-
neutral portfolio? The answer is no. A dollar-neutral portfolio is


<!-- PAGE 66 -->

44
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
self-ﬁnancing, meaning the cash you get from selling short pays for
the purchase of the long securities, so the ﬁnancing cost (due to the
spread between the credit and debit interest rates) is small and can
be neglected for many backtesting purposes. Meanwhile, the mar-
gin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the
risk-free rate rF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return
minus the contribution from the credit interest) is R, and the risk-
free rate is rF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe
ratio is R + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free
rate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to
your stock positions.
Similarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does
not hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the
risk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess
returns, since you do not have ﬁnancing costs in this case, either. In
general, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy
returns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs
ﬁnancing cost.
To further facilitate comparison across strategies, most traders
annualize the Sharpe ratio. Most people know how to annualize the
average returns. For example, if you have been using monthly re-
turns, then the average annual return is just 12 times the average
monthly return.
However, annualizing the standard deviation of returns is a bit
trickier. Here, based on the assumption that the monthly returns are
serially uncorrelated (Sharpe, 1994), the annual standard deviation
of returns is
√
12 times the monthly standard deviation. Hence, over-
all, the annualized Sharpe ratio would be
√
12 times the monthly
Sharpe ratio.
In general, if you calculate your average and standard deviation
of returns based on a certain trading period T, whether T is a month,
a day, or an hour, and you want to annualize these quantities, you
have to ﬁrst ﬁnd out how many such trading periods there are in a
year (call it NT). Then
Annualized Sharpe Ratio =

NT × Sharpe Ratio Based on T


<!-- PAGE 67 -->

Backtesting
45
For example, if your strategy holds positions only during the NYSE
market hours (9:30–16:00 ET), and the average hourly returns is R,
and the standard deviation of the hourly returns is s, then the annu-
alized Sharpe ratio is
√
1638 × R/s. This is because NT = (252 trad-
ing days) × (6.5 trading hours per trading day) = 1,638. (A common
mistake is to compute NT as 252 × 24 = 6,048.)
Example 3.4: Calculating Sharpe Ratio for Long-Only Versus
Market-Neutral Strategies
Let’s calculate the Sharpe ratio of a trivial long-only strategy for IGE: buy-
ing and holding a share since the close of November 26, 2001, and selling
it at close of November 14, 2007. Assume the average risk-free rate dur-
ing this period is 4 percent per annum in this example. You can download
the daily prices from Yahoo! Finance, specifying the date range desired,
and store them as an Excel ﬁle (not the default comma-separated ﬁle),
which you can call IGE.xls. The next steps can be done in either Excel or
MATLAB:
Using Excel
1. The ﬁle should have columns A–G already from the download.
2. Sort all the columns in ascending order of Date (use the Data-Sort
function, choose the “Expand the selection” radio button, and choose
the “Ascending” as well as the “My data has Header row” radio
buttons).
3. In cell H3, type “=(G3-G2)/G2”. This is the daily return.
4. Double-clicking the little black dot at the lower right corner of the
cell H3 will populate the entire column H with daily returns of
IGE.
5. For clarity, you can type “Dailyret” in the header cell H1.
6. In cell I3, type “=H3-0.04/252”, which is the excess daily return, as-
suming a 4 percent per annum risk-free rate and 252 trading days in a
year.
7. Double-clicking the little black dot at the lower right corner of cell I3
will populate the entire column I with excess daily returns.
8. For clarity, type “Excess Dailyret” in the header cell I1.

This MATLAB code is also available for download at my web site
(epchan.com/book/example3 4.m).
Now let’s calculate the Sharpe ratio of a long-short market-neutral strat-
egy. In fact, it is a very trivial twist of the buy-and-hold strategy above: at the
time we bought IGE, let’s suppose we just shorted an equal dollar amount
of Standard & Poor’s depositary receipts (SPY) as a hedge, and closed both

positions at the same time in November 2007. You can also download SPY
from Yahoo! Finance and store it in a ﬁle SPY.xls. You can go through very
similar steps as above in both Excel and MATLAB, and I will leave it as an
exercise for the reader to perform the exact steps:
Using Excel
1. Sort the columns in SPY.xls in ascending order of date just like above.
2. Copy column G (Adj Close) in SPY.xls and paste it onto column J of
IGE.xls above.
3. Check that column J has the same number of rows as columns A–I. If
not, you have a diﬀerent set of dates—make sure you download the
matching date range from Yahoo!.
4. Perform the same steps as above to calculate the daily returns in col-
umn K.
5. For clarity, type “dailyretSPY” as the header in column K.
6. In column L, compute the net returns for the hedged strategy as the
diﬀerence between column H and K divided by 2. (Divide by 2 because
we now have twice the capital.)
7. In cell L1506, compute the Sharpe ratio of this hedged strategy. You
should get “0.783681”.
Using MATLAB
% Assume this is a continuation of the above MATLAB

% Insert your own code here to retrieve data from

Example 3.5: Calculating Maximum Drawdown and Maximum
Drawdown Duration
We shall continue the preceding long-short market-neutral example in order
to illustrate the calculation of maximum drawdown and maximum draw-
down duration. The ﬁrst step in this calculation is to calculate the “high
watermark” at the close of each day, which is the maximum cumulative re-
turn of the strategy up to that time. (Using the cumulative return curve to
calculate high watermark and drawdown is equivalent to using the equity
curve, since equity is nothing more than initial investment times 1 plus the
cumulative return.) From the high watermark, we can calculate the draw-
down, the maximum drawdown, and maximum drawdown duration.
Using Excel
1. In cell M3, type “=L3”.
2. In cell M4, type “=(1+M3)*(1+L4)-1”. This is the cumulative com-
pounded return of the strategy up to that day. Populate the entire col-
umn M with the cumulative compounded returns of the strategy and
erase the last cell of the column. Name this column Cumret.
3. In cell N3, type “=M3”.
4. In cell N4, type “=MAX(N3, M4)”. This is the high watermark up to that
day. Populate the entire column N with the running high watermark of
the strategy and erase the last cell of the column. Name this column
High watermark.
5. In cell O3, type “=(1+N3)/(1+M3)-1”. This is the drawdown at that day’s
close. Populate the entire column O with the drawdowns of the strategy.
6. In cell O1506, type “=MAX(O3:O1505)”. This is the maximum draw-
down of the strategy. It should have a value of about 0.1053, that is, a
maximum drawdown of 10.53 percent.
7. In cell P3, type “=IF(O3=0, 0, P2+1)”. This is the duration of the current
drawdown. Populate the entire column R with the drawdown durations
of the strategy and erase the last cell of the column.
8. In cell P1506, type “=MAX(P3:P1505)”. This is the maximum drawdown
duration of the strategy. It should have a value of 497, that is, a maxi-
mum drawdown duration of 497 trading days.

COMMON BACKTESTING PITFALLS
TO AVOID
Backtesting is the process of creating the historical trades given the
historical information available at that time, and then ﬁnding out
what the subsequent performance of those trades is. This process
seems easy given that the trades were made using a computer algo-
rithm in our case, but there are numerous ways in which it can go
wrong. Usually, an erroneous backtest would produce a historical
performance that is better than what we would have obtained in ac-
tual trading. We have already seen how survivorship bias in the data
used for backtesting can result in inﬂated performance. There are,


<!-- PAGE 73 -->

Backtesting
51
however, other common pitfalls related to how the backtest pro-
gram is written, or more fundamentally, to how you construct your
trading strategy. I will describe two of the most common ones here,
with tips on how to avoid them.
Look-Ahead Bias
This error refers to the situation when you are using information
that was available only at a time ahead of the instant the trade was
made. For example, if your trade entry rule reads: “Buy when the
stock is within 1 percent of the day’s low,” you have introduced a
look-ahead bias in your strategy, because you could not possibly
have known what the day’s low was until the market closed that
day. Another example: Suppose a model involves a linear regression
ﬁt of two price series. If you use the regression coefﬁcients obtained
from the entire data set to determine your daily trading signals, you
have again introduced look-ahead bias.
How do we avoid look-ahead bias? Use lagged historical data
for calculating signals at every opportunity. Lagging a series of data
means that you calculate all the quantities like moving averages,
highs and lows, or even volume, based on data up to the close of the
previous trading period only. (Of course, you needn’t lag the data if
your strategy enters only at the close of the period.)
Look-ahead bias is easier to avoid using Excel or other WYSI-
WYG programs than using MATLAB. This is because it is easy to
align all the different columns of data in Excel and ensure that the
formula in each cell is computed based on the rows above the cur-
rent row. It would be visually obvious when one is using current
day’s data in generating signals, given the cell-highlighting function-
ality in Excel. (Double-clicking a cell with a formula will highlight
the cells of data this formula utilizes.) With MATLAB, you have to
be more careful and remember to run a lag function on certain se-
ries used for signal generation.
Even with all the care and caution that goes into creating a
backtest program without look-ahead bias, sometimes we may
still let some of it slip in. Some look-ahead bias is quite subtle in
nature and not easy to avoid, especially if you are using MATLAB.


<!-- PAGE 74 -->

52
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
It is best to do a ﬁnal checkup of your MATLAB backtest program
using this method: Run the program using all your historical data;
generate and save the resulting position ﬁle to ﬁle A (position ﬁle
is the ﬁle that contains all the recommended positions generated
by the program on each day). Now truncate your historical data so
that the most recent portion (say N days) is removed. So if the last
day in the original data is T, then the last day in the truncated data
should be T-N. N could be 10 days to 100 days. Now run the back-
test program again using the truncated data and save the resulting
positions into a new ﬁle B. Truncate the most recent N rows of the
positions ﬁle A so that both A and B have the same number of rows
(days) in them, and the last day in both ﬁle A and B should be T-N.
Finally, check if A and B are identical in their positions. If not, you
have a look-ahead bias in your backtest program that you must ﬁnd
and correct, because the discrepancies in positions mean that you
are inadvertently using the truncated part of the historical data (the
part that lies ahead of day T-N) in determining the positions in ﬁle
A. I will illustrate this somewhat convoluted procedure at the end of
Example 3.6.
Data-Snooping Bias
In Chapter 2, I mentioned data-snooping bias—the danger that back-
test performance is inﬂated relative to the future performance of
the strategy because we have overoptimized the parameters of the
model based on transient noise in the historical data. Data snoop-
ing bias is pervasive in the business of predictive statistical models
of historical data, but is especially serious in ﬁnance because of the
limited amount of independent data we have. High-frequency data,
while in abundant supply, is useful only for high-frequency models.
And while we have stock market data stretching back to the early
parts of the twentieth century, only data within the past 10 years
are really suitable for building predictive model. Furthermore, as
discussed in Chapter 2, regime shifts may render even data that are
just a few years old obsolete for backtesting purposes. The less inde-
pendent data you have, the fewer adjustable parameters you should
employ in your trading model.


<!-- PAGE 75 -->

Backtesting
53
As a rule of thumb, I would not employ more than ﬁve param-
eters, including quantities such as entry and exit thresholds, hold-
ing period, or the lookback period, in computing moving averages.
Furthermore, not all data-snooping bias is due to the optimization
of parameters. Numerous choices one makes in creating a trad-
ing model can be affected by repeated backtesting on the same
data set—decisions such as whether to enter at the open or close,
whether to hold the positions overnight, whether to trade large-cap
or mid-cap stocks. Often, these qualitative decisions are made to
optimize the backtest performance, but they may not be optimal go-
ing forward. It is almost impossible to completely eliminate data-
snooping bias as long as we are building data-driven models. How-
ever, there are ways to mitigate the bias.
Sample Size
The most basic safeguard against data-snooping bias
is to ensure that you have a sufﬁcient amount of backtest data rel-
ative to the number of free parameters you want to optimize. As a
rule of thumb, let’s assume that the number of data points needed
for optimizing your parameters is equal to 252 times the number
of free parameters your model has. (This assumption of propor-
tionality is not based on any survey of the vast statistical litera-
ture, but purely on experience.) So, for example, let’s assume you
have a daily trading model with three parameters. Then you should
have at least three years’ worth of backtest data with daily prices.
However, if you have a three-parameter trading model that updates
positions every minute, then you should have at least 252/390 year,
or about seven months, of one-minute backtest data. (Note that if
you have a daily trading model, then even if you have seven months
of minute-by-minute data points, effectively you only have about
7 × 21 = 147 data points, far from sufﬁcient for testing a three-
parameter model.)
Out-of-Sample Testing
Divide your historical data into two parts.
Save the second (more recent) part of the data for out-of-sample
testing. When you build the model, optimize the parameters as well
as other qualitative decisions on the ﬁrst portion (called the train-
ing set), but test the resulting model on the second portion (called


<!-- PAGE 76 -->

54
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
the test set). (The two portions should be roughly equal in size, but if
there is insufﬁcient training data, we should at least have one-third
as much test data as training data. The minimum size of the training
set is determined by the rule of thumb in the previous section.) Ide-
ally, the set of optimal parameters and decisions for the ﬁrst part of
the backtest period is also the optimal set for the second period, but
things are rarely this perfect. The performance on the second part
of the data should at least be reasonable. Otherwise, the model has
data-snooping bias built into it, and one way to cure it is to simplify
the model and eliminate some parameters.
A more rigorous (albeit more computationally intensive)
method of out-of-sample testing is to use moving optimization of
the parameters. In this case, the parameters themselves are con-
stantly adapting to the changing historical data, and data-snooping
bias with respect to parameters is eliminated. (See the sidebar on
parameterless trading models.)

his trading models have “no free parameters.” In keeping with the tradition of
secrecy in our industry, he would not divulge his technique further.
Lately, I have begun to understand what a trading model with no free pa-
rameters means. It doesn’t mean that it does not contain, for example, any
lookback period for calculating trends, or thresholds for entry or exit. I think
that would be impossible. It just means that all such parameters are dynami-
cally optimized in a moving lookback window. This way, if you ask, “Does the
model have a ﬁxed proﬁt cap?,” the trader can honestly reply: “No, proﬁt cap is
not an input parameter. It is determined by the model itself.”
The advantage of a parameterless trading model is that it minimizes the
danger of overﬁtting the model to multiple input parameters (the so-called
“data-snooping bias”). So the backtest performance should be much closer to
the actual forward performance.
(Note that parameter optimization does not necessarily mean picking one
best set of parameters that give the best backtest performance. Often, it is
better to make a trading decision based on some kind of averages over diﬀerent
sets of parameters.)
Now, it is quite computationally challenging to optimize all these parame-
ters just in time for your next order, but it is often even more diﬃcult to do that
in a backtest, given that a multidimensional optimization needs to be performed

for each historical bar. As a result, I personally have seldom traded parameter-
less models, until I get to research my regime-switching model described in
Example 7.1. That model is almost parameterless (I left out a few parameters
from optimization because of a lack of time, not because of any technical dif-
ﬁculties). How was I able to perform backtest parameter optimization within a
few minutes in this case? I got to use a high-end backtesting platform (Alphacet
Discovery).
*This section was adapted from my blog article “Parameterless Trading Models,” which you
can ﬁnd at epchan.blogspot.com/2008/05/parameterless-trading-models.html.
The ultimate out-of-sample testing is familiar to many traders,
and it is called paper trading. Running the model on actual unseen
data is the most reliable way to test it (short of actually trading it).
Paper trading not only allows you to perform a truly honest out-
of-sample test; it often allows you to discover look-ahead errors in
your programs, as well as making you aware of various operational
issues. I will discuss paper trading in Chapter 5.
If the strategy that you are testing comes from a published
source, and you are just conducting a backtest to verify that the re-
sults are correct, then the entire period between the time of publi-
cation and the time that you tested the strategy is a genuine out-of-
sample period. As long as you do not optimize the parameters of the
published model on the out-of-sample period, this period is as good
as paper trading the strategy.
Example 3.6: Pair Trading of GLD and GDX
This example will illustrate how to separate the data into a training set and a
test set. We will backtest a pair-trading strategy and optimize its parameters
on the training set and look at the eﬀect on the test set.
GLD versus GDX is a good candidate for pair trading because GLD
reﬂects the spot price of gold, and GDX is a basket of gold-mining
stocks. It makes intuitive sense that their prices should move in tandem.
I have discussed this pair of ETFs extensively on my blog in connec-
tion with cointegration analysis (see, e.g., epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/

reader-suggested-possible-trading.html). Here, however, I will defer until
Chapter 7 the cointegration analysis on the training set, which demon-
strates that the spread formed by long GLD and short GDX is mean re-
verting. Instead, we will perform a regression analysis on the training set
to determine the hedge ratio between GLD and GDX, and then deﬁne entry
and exit thresholds for a pair-trading strategy. We will see how optimiz-
ing these thresholds on the training set changes the performance on the
test set. (This program is available as on epchan.com/book/example3 6.m.
The data ﬁles are available as GDX.xls and GLD.xls. This program uses

cluded at epchan.com/book as well. It also uses a function “ols” for lin-
ear regression, which is part of a free package downloaded from spatial-
econometrics.com.)

end
So this pair-trading strategy has excellent Sharpe ratios on both the
training set and the test set. Therefore, this strategy can be considered free
of data-snooping bias. However, there may be room for improvement. Let’s


<!-- PAGE 81 -->

Backtesting
59
see what happens if we change the entry thresholds to 1 standard deviation
and exit threshold to 0.5 standard deviation. In this case, the Sharpe ratio
on the training set increases to 2.9 and the Sharpe ratio on the test set
increases to 2.1. So, clearly, this set of thresholds is better.
Often, however, optimizing the parameters on the training set may de-
crease the performance on the test set. In this situation, you should choose
a set of parameters that result in good (but may not be the best) perfor-
mance on both training and test sets.
I have not incorporated transaction costs (which I discuss in the next
section) into this analysis. You can try to add that as an exercise. Since this
strategy doesn’t trade very frequently, transaction costs do not have a big
impact on the resulting Sharpe ratio.
To see why this strategy works, just take a look at the Figure 7.4 of the
spread, which I will discuss in connection with stationarity and cointegration
in Chapter 7. You can see that the spread behaves in a highly mean-reverting
manner. Hence, buying low and selling high over and over again works well
here.
One last check, though, that we should perform before calling this a
success: We need to check for any look-ahead bias in the backtest program.
Add the following code fragment to the MATLAB code above after the line
“cl2=adjcls2(idx2);”
% number of most recent trading days to cut off
cutoff=60;% remove the last cutoff number of days.
tday(end-cutoff+1:end, :)=[];
cl1(end-cutoff+1:end, :)=[];
cl2(end-cutoff+1:end, :)=[];
Add the following code fragment to the very end of the previous
MATLAB program, replacing the line “save example3 6 positions positions”.
% step two of look-forward-bias check
oldoutput=load(‘example3 6 positions’);
oldoutput.positions(end-cutoff+1:end, :)=[];
if (any(positions∼=oldoutput.positions))
fprintf(1, ‘Program has look-forward-bias!\n’);
end
Save this new program into ﬁle “example3 6 1.m” and run it. You
will ﬁnd that the sentence “Program has look-forward-bias” is not printed
out—this indicates that our algorithm passed our test.

Sensitivity Analysis
Once you have optimized your parameters
as well as various features of your model and have veriﬁed that its
performance on a test set is still reasonable, vary these parameters
or make some small qualitative changes in the features of the model
and see how the performance changes on both the training and the
test sets. If the drop is so drastic that any parameter set other than
the optimal one is unacceptable, the model most likely suffers from
data-snooping bias.
There are some variations on your model that are particularly
important to try: the various ways to simplify the model. Do you
really need, say, ﬁve different conditions to determine whether
to make that trade? What if you eliminate the conditions one
by one—at what point does the performance on the training set
deteriorate to an unacceptable level? And more important: Is there
a corresponding decrease in performance on the test set as you
eliminate the conditions? In general, you should eliminate as many
conditions, constraints, and parameters as possible as long as
there is no signiﬁcant decrease in performance in the test set, even
though it may decrease performance on the training set. (But you
should not add conditions and parameters, or adjust the parameter
values, so as to improve performance on the test set: If you do, you
have effectively used the test set as your training set and possibly
reintroduce data-snooping bias to your model.)
When one has reduced the set of parameters and conditions that
trigger a trade to the minimum, and after one has ascertained that
small variations in these parameters and conditions do not drasti-
cally alter the out-of-sample performance, one should consider di-
viding the trading capital across the different parameter values and
sets of conditions. This averaging over parameters will further help
ensure that the actual trading performance of the model will not de-
viate too much from the backtest result.
TRANSACTION COSTS
No backtest performance is realistic without incorporating trans-
action costs. I discussed the various types of transactions costs


<!-- PAGE 83 -->

Backtesting
61
(commission, liquidity cost, opportunity cost, market impact, and
slippage) in Chapter 2 and have given examples of how to incorpo-
rate transaction costs into the backtest of a strategy. It should not
surprise you to ﬁnd that a strategy with a high Sharpe ratio before
adding transaction costs can become very unproﬁtable after adding
such costs. I will illustrate this in Example 3.7.
Example 3.7: A Simple Mean-Reverting Model with and
without Transaction Costs
Here is a simple mean-reverting model that is due to Amir Khan-
dani and Andrew Lo at MIT (available at web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/
august07.pdf). This strategy is very simple: Buy the stocks with the worst
previous one-day returns, and short the ones with the best previous one-
day returns. Despite its utter simplicity, this strategy has had great perfor-
mance since 1995, ignoring transaction costs (it has a Sharpe ratio of 4.47
in 2006). Our objective here is to ﬁnd out what would happen to its perfor-
mance in 2006 if we assume a standard 5-basis-point-per-trade transaction
cost. (A trade is deﬁned as a buy or a short, not a round-trip transaction.)
This example strategy not only allows us to illustrate the impact of trans-
action costs, it also illustrates the power of MATLAB in backtesting a model
that trades multiple securities—in other words, a typical statistical arbitrage
model. Backtesting a model with a large number of symbols over multiple
years is often too cumbersome to perform in Excel. But even assuming that
you have MATLAB at your disposal, there is still the question of how to re-
trieve historical data for hundreds of symbols, especially survivorship-bias-
free data. Here, we will put aside the question of survivorship bias because
of the expensive nature of such data and just bear in mind that whatever
performance estimates we obtained are upper bounds on the actual perfor-
mance of the strategy.
Whenever one wants to backtest a stock selection strategy, the ﬁrst
question is always: Which universe of stocks? The typical starting point is
the S&P 500 stock universe, which is the most liquid set of stocks avail-
able. The current list of stocks in the S&P 500 is available for download at
the Standard & Poor’s website (www.standardandpoors.com). Since the con-
stituents of this universe change constantly, the list that you download will
be diﬀerent from mine. For ease of comparison, you can ﬁnd my list saved
as epchan.com/book/SP500 20071121.xls. The easiest way to download
historical data for all these stocks is to buy a copy of the HQuote Pro soft-
ware (referenced earlier in this chapter, available from HQuote.com.) This

software conveniently allows you to cut and paste any list of symbols for
which you want data. Run an update on your list in the software so as to re-
trieve the data from January 1, 2000, to the present day and then export this
data to a single text ﬁle called “Export.txt,” choosing only columns Date,
Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume, without header. Now, use the follow-
ing MATLAB program (epchan.com/book/retrieveHQuoteHistoricalPrice.m)
to parse this data into a form useful for our computation, and which saves
it to a binary ﬁle “SPX 20071123.mat” on your local directory:
clear;
inputFile=‘Export.txt’;
outputFile=‘SPX 20071123’;
[mysym, mytday, myop, myhi, mylo, mycl, myvol]=...
textread(inputFile, ‘%s %u %f %f %f %f %u’, ...
‘delimiter’, ‘,’);
% Since the single file consists of many symbols,
% we need to find the unique set of symbols.
stocks=unique(mysym);
% Since the single file consists of many repeating set
% of dates for different symbols, we need to find the
% unique set of dates.
tday=unique(mytday);
op=NaN(length(tday), length(stocks));
hi=NaN(length(tday), length(stocks));
lo=NaN(length(tday), length(stocks));
cl=NaN(length(tday), length(stocks));
vol=NaN(length(tday), length(stocks));
for s=1:length(stocks)
stk=stocks{s};
% find the locations (indices) of the data with
% the current symbol.
idxA=strmatch(stk, mysym, ‘exact’);
% find the
locations (indices) of the data with
% the current set of dates.

op(idxtB, s)=myop(idxA(idxtA));
hi(idxtB, s)=myhi(idxA(idxtA));
lo(idxtB, s)=mylo(idxA(idxtA));
cl(idxtB, s)=mycl(idxA(idxtA));
vol(idxtB, s)=myvol(idxA(idxtA));
end
save(outputFile,
‘tday’, ‘stocks’, ‘op’, ‘hi’, ...
‘lo’, ‘cl’, ‘vol’);
Next, we can use this historical data set to backtest the mean-reverting
strategy without transaction cost:
clear;
startDate=20060101;
endDate=20061231;
load(‘SPX 20071123’, ‘tday’, ‘stocks’, ‘cl’);
% daily returns
dailyret=(cl-lag1(cl))./lag1(cl);
% equal weighted market index return
marketDailyret=smartmean(dailyret, 2);
% weight of a stock is proportional to the negative
% distance to the market index.

% those stocks that do not have valid prices or
% daily returns are excluded.

dailypnl=smartsum(lag1(weights).*dailyret, 2);
% remove pnl outside of our dates of interest
dailypnl(tday < startDate | tday > endDate) = [];
% Sharpe ratio should be about 0.25
sharpe=...
sqrt(252)*smartmean(dailypnl, 1)/smartstd(dailypnl, 1)
This ﬁle was saved as epchan.com/book/example3 7.m on my web
site. Notice that the Sharpe ratio in 2006 is only 0.25, not 4.47 as stated
by the original authors. The reason for this drastically lower performance


<!-- PAGE 86 -->

64
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
is due to the use of the large market capitalization universe of S&P 500 in
our backtest. If you read the original paper by the authors, you will ﬁnd that
most of the returns are generated by small and microcap stocks.
In this MATLAB program, I have used three new functions: “smart-
sum,” “smartmean,” and “smartstd.” They are very similar to the usual
“sum,” “mean,” and “std” functions, except they skip all the NaN entries
in the data. These functions are very useful in backtesting because price
series for stocks often starts and stops. These ﬁles are all available at
epchan.com/book.
function y = smartsum(x, dim)
%y = smartsum(x, dim)
%Sum along dimension dim, ignoring NaN.
hasData=isfinite(x);
x(∼hasData)=0;
y=sum(x,dim);
y(all(∼hasData, dim))=NaN;
"smartmean.m"
function y = smartmean(x, dim)
% y = smartmean(x, dim)
% Mean value along dimension dim, ignoring NaN.
hasData=isfinite(x);
x(∼hasData)=0;
y=sum(x,dim)./sum(hasData, dim);
y(all(∼hasData, dim))=NaN; % set y to NaN if all en-
tries are NaN’s.

%y = smartstd(x, dim)
% std along dimension dim, ignoring NaN and Inf
hasData=isfinite(x);
x(∼hasData)=0;
y=std(x);
y(all(∼hasData, dim))=NaN;
Now, continuing with our backtest, let’s see what happens if we deduct
a 5-basis-point transaction cost for every trade.
% daily pnl with transaction costs deducted
onewaytcost=0.0005; % assume 5 basis points

The strategy is now very unproﬁtable!
STRATEGY REFINEMENT
If a strategy does not deliver superb backtest performance on ﬁrst
trial, there are some common ways to improve it. How to reﬁne a
strategy without introducing data-snooping bias and to remain sim-
ple with few parameters is more of an art than a science. The guid-
ing principle is the same as that of parameter optimization: What-
ever changes you make to the strategy to improve its performance
on the training set, it must also improve the performance on the
test set.
Often, there are some very simple strategies that are fairly well
known in traders’ circles and are still somewhat proﬁtable, though
their returns seem to be diminishing. An example is the pair trad-
ing of stocks. The reason they are diminishing in returns is that too
many traders are taking advantage of this arbitrage opportunity and
gradually erasing the proﬁt margin. However, it is often possible to
introduce minor variations in the basic strategy, which will boost its
returns.
These minor variations are often far less well known than the
basic strategy, and therefore far less well exploited by traders.
Sometimes they involve excluding certain stocks or groups of stocks
from the universe. For example, traders often prefer to exclude


<!-- PAGE 88 -->

66
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
pharmaceutical stocks from their technical trading program be-
cause of the dramatic impact of news on their prices, or else they
may exclude stocks that have pending merger or acquisition deals.
Other traders change the entry and exit timing or frequency of the
trades. Yet another variation concerns the selection of the stock uni-
verse: We saw in Example 3.7 that a strategy that has a very good
Sharpe ratio when it is applied to small-cap stocks becomes very
unproﬁtable when applied to large-cap stocks.
When introducing these reﬁnements to your strategy, it is
preferable that the reﬁnement has some basis in fundamental eco-
nomics or a well-studied market phenomenon, rather than some
arbitrary rule based on trial and error. Otherwise, data-snooping
bias looms.
Example 3.8: A Small Variation on an Existing Strategy
Let’s reﬁne the mean-reverting strategy described above in Example 3.7.
Recall that strategy has a mediocre Sharpe ratio of 0.25 and a very unprof-
itable Sharpe ratio of –3.19 after transaction costs in 2006. The only change
we will make here is to update the positions at the market open instead of
the close. In the MATLAB code, simply replace “cl” with “op” everywhere.
Lo and behold, the Sharpe ratio before costs increases to 4.43, and
after costs, it increases to a proﬁtable 0.78! I will leave it as an exercise for
the reader to improve the Sharpe ratio further by testing the strategy on
the S&P 400 mid-cap and S&P 600 small-cap universes.
SUMMARY
Backtesting is about conducting a realistic historical simulation of
the performance of a strategy. The hope is that the future perfor-
mance of the strategy will resemble its past performance, though as
your investment manager will never tire of telling you, this is by no
means guaranteed!
There are many nuts and bolts involved in creating a realis-
tic historical backtest and in reducing the divergence of the future

performance of the strategy from its backtest performance. Issues
discussed here include:
r Data: Split/dividend adjustments, noise in daily high/low, and
survivorship bias.
r Performance measurement: Annualized Sharpe ratio and maxi-
mum drawdown.
r Look-ahead bias: Using unobtainable future information for past
trading decisions.
r Data-snooping bias: Using too many parameters to ﬁt historical
data, and avoiding it using large enough sample, out-of-sample
testing, and sensitivity analysis.
r Transaction cost: Impact of transaction costs on performance.
r Strategy reﬁnement: Common ways to make small variations on
the strategy to optimize performance.
After going through this chapter and working through some of
the examples and exercises, you should have gained some hands-on
experience in how to retrieve historical data and backtest a strategy
with either Excel or MATLAB.
When one starts testing a strategy, it may not be possible to
avoid all these pitfalls due to constraints of time and other re-
sources. In this case, it is okay to skip a few precautions to achieve
a quick sense of whether the strategy has potential and is worthy of
closer examination. Sometimes, even the most thorough and careful
backtest cannot reveal problems that would be obvious after a few
months of paper or real trading. One can always revisit each of these
issues after the model has gone live.
Once you have backtested a strategy with reasonable perfor-
mance, you are now ready to take the next step in setting up your
trading business.

Setting Up
Your Business
I
n this chapter, we will be taking a break from the technical as-
pect of trading to focus on the business side of it. Assuming that
your goal is to remain an independent trader and not work for
a money management institution, the choice of the business struc-
ture for trading is important. The main choice you have to make is
whether to open a retail brokerage account or to join a proprietary
trading ﬁrm. The next step is to determine what features of the bro-
kerage or trading ﬁrm are important to you. Finally, you have to de-
cide what kind of physical trading infrastructure you need in order
to execute your quantitative strategy.
BUSINESS STRUCTURE: RETAIL
OR PROPRIETARY?
As a trader, you can choose to be completely independent or semi-
independent. To be completely independent, you can simply open a
retail brokerage account, deposit some cash, and start trading. No
one will question your strategy, and no one will guide you in your
trading. Furthermore, your leverage is limited by Securities and Ex-
change Commission (SEC) Regulation T—roughly two times your
69


<!-- PAGE 92 -->

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
equity if you hold overnight positions. Naturally, all the proﬁts and
losses will accrue to you.
However, you can choose to join what is called a “proprietary
trading ﬁrm” such as Bright Trading, ECHOtrade, or Genesis Secu-
rities, and become a member of their ﬁrm. In order to become a
member of such ﬁrms, you have to pass the National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD) Series 7 examination to qualify you as a
registered representative of a brokerage. You will still need to in-
vest your own capital to start an account, but you will obtain much
higher leverage (or “buying power”) than is available through a re-
tail account. Depending on how much capital you invested, you may
get to keep all your proﬁts, or some percentage of them. In terms
of liability, however, your loss is limited to your initial investment.
(Actually, liability is also limited if you form an S corporation or lim-
ited liability company [LLC] and open an account through this entity
at a retail brokerage.) Often, you can also receive training from the
ﬁrm, perhaps at an extra cost. You will also be subject to the vari-
ous rules and regulations that the proprietary trading ﬁrm chooses
to impose on its members, in addition to rules imposed by the SEC
or NASD.
I made them sound like bad things when I spoke of rules and reg-
ulations imposed by proprietary trading ﬁrms. But, actually, some
of these rules (such as the prohibition from trading penny stocks
or the prohibition from carrying short positions overnight) are ac-
tually risk management measures for your own protection. Often,
when the going is good, traders will bemoan these constraints lim-
iting their ﬂexibility and proﬁtability. They may even decide to start
their own retail trading accounts and start trading on their own.
However, when they suffer the (almost inevitable) big drawdown,
they wish that someone were there to restrain their risk appetites
and come to regret this unfettered freedom. (The teenager in us has
never left after all.)
The decision whether to go retail or to join a proprietary trad-
ing ﬁrm is generally based on your need of capital, the style of your
strategy, and your skill level. For example, if you run a low-risk,
market-neutral strategy that nevertheless requires a much higher
leverage than allowed by Regulation T in order to generate good

returns, a proprietary account may be better for you. However, if
you engage in high-frequency futures trading that does not require
too much capital, a retail account may save you a lot of costs and
hassles. Similarly, a very experienced trader with strong risk man-
agement practices and emotional stability probably doesn’t need the
guidance given by a proprietary ﬁrm, but less experienced traders
may beneﬁt from the imposed restraints.
There is another consideration that applies to those of you who
have discovered some unique, highly proﬁtable strategies. In this sit-
uation, you may prefer to open a retail trading account, because if
you trade through a proprietary account, your proprietary trading
ﬁrm is going to ﬁnd out about your highly proﬁtable strategy and
may “piggyback” on your strategy with a lot of its own capital. In
this case, your strategy will suffer more market impact trading cost
as time goes on.
Table 4.1 summarizes the pros and cons for each choice.
One ﬁnal note: Some may think that there is a tax advantage
in joining a proprietary trading ﬁrm because any trading loss can
be deducted from current income instead of as capital loss. Ac-
tually, you can choose to apply for trader tax status even if you
have a retail brokerage account so that your trading loss can off-
set other income, and not just other capital gain. For details on the
tax considerations of a trading business, you can visit, for example,

CHOOSING A BROKERAGE OR
PROPRIETARY TRADING FIRM
Many traders use only one criterion to choose their brokerage or a
proprietary trading ﬁrm to join: the commission rate. This is clearly
an important criterion because if a trading strategy has a small re-
turn, high commissions may render it unproﬁtable. However, there
are other important considerations.
Commissions actually form only part of your total transaction
costs, sometimes even a small part. The speed of execution of
your brokerage as well as their access of the so-called “dark-pool”

liquidity also ﬁgures into your transaction costs. Dark-pool liquid-
ity is formed by institutional orders facilitated away from the ex-
changes, or they come from the crossing of internal brokerage cus-
tomer orders. These orders are not displayed as bid and ask quotes.
Some of the “alternative trading systems” that provide dark-pool
liquidity are Liquidnet and ITG’s Posit. Your brokerage may use one
or more of these providers, it may only use its internal crossing net-
work, or it may use no alternative trading systems at all.
Sometimes, a better execution price at a large brokerage due
to its state-of-the-art execution system and high-speed access to
deeper dark pools of liquidity will more than compensate for its
higher commissions. This kind of cost/beneﬁt analysis cannot eas-
ily be carried out unless you actually trade on multiple brokerages
simultaneously and compare the actual execution costs.
For example, I trade through Goldman Sachs’s REDIPlus trading
platform, whose Sigma X execution engine routes orders to both its
internal crossing network as well as to external liquidity providers.
I have found that it often improves my execution price by more than
a few cents per share over execution on Interactive Brokers: more
than enough to offset its higher commissions.
Another consideration is the range of products you can trade.
Many retail brokerages or proprietary trading ﬁrms do not allow you
to trade futures or foreign currencies. This would be a serious limi-
tation to your trading business’s growth.
Following these two fairly generic criteria, for a quantitative
trader, the next important one is: Does the trading platform offer an
application programming interface (API) so that your trading soft-
ware can receive live data feed, generate orders, and automatically
transmit the orders for execution in your account? I will discuss
more about API in Chapter 5. The only point to note here is that
without an API, high-frequency quantitative trading is impossible.
Closely related to the availability of API is the availability of pa-
per trading accounts. If a brokerage does not offer you a paper trad-
ing account, it is very hard to test an API without risking real losses.
Among the brokerages I know that offer paper trading accounts are
Interactive Brokers, Genesis Securities, PFG Futures (for futures
trading), and Oanda (for currency trading).


<!-- PAGE 96 -->

74
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
In addition to paper trading accounts, some brokerages provide
a “simulator” account (an example is the demo account from
Interactive Brokers), where quotes from the past are displayed as if
they were real-time quotes, and an automated trading program can
trade against these quotes at any time of the day in order to debug
the program.
Finally, the reputation and ﬁnancial strength of the proprietary
trading ﬁrm you are considering is also important. This does not
matter to the choice of a retail brokerage because, as noted in Ta-
ble 4.1, retail accounts are insured by the SIPC whereas proprietary
accounts are not. Hence, it is important that a proprietary trading
ﬁrm has a strong balance sheet and good risk management practices
to prevent the ﬁrm from collapsing because of bad trades made by
its fellow member traders. (WorldCom’s and Refco’s collapses are
good examples.) You should also make sure the ﬁrm is a broker-
dealer registered with an exchange, so that it is regularly audited by
the exchange and the SEC. (As of this writing, non-broker-dealer
proprietary trading ﬁrms may all get shut down by the SEC any-
way, starting with Tuco Trading in March 2008.) Furthermore, even
if times are good for the ﬁrm, does it have a good reputation for
easy redemption of your capital should you choose to do so? It is,
of course, difﬁcult for an outsider to assess whether a proprietary
trading ﬁrm has such good attributes, but you can read about the
ﬁrm’s reputation based on their current or ex-members’ opinions at
the online forum www.elitetrader.com.
If you are undecided whether to open a retail brokerage account
or a proprietary account, or which retail brokerage or proprietary
ﬁrm to use, you can in fact do both, or open multiple accounts. Un-
like ﬁnding full-time employment in proprietary trading ﬁrms, just
joining them as a member, especially a remote-access member, does
not usually compel you to sign a noncompete agreement. You are
free to be a member of more than one proprietary ﬁrm, or have both
proprietary and retail trading accounts, as long as this fact is fully
disclosed to the proprietary trading ﬁrms involved and to the NASD
as “outside business activities” and prior permissions obtained. With
multiple accounts, it should be easier for you decide which cost
structure is more beneﬁcial to you and which account has the better

75
infrastructure and tools for your automated trading system. And, in
fact, sometimes each account has its own pros and cons, and you
may want to have the ﬂexibility of keeping all of them open for trad-
ing different strategies!
PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Now that you have set up the legal and administrative structure of
your trading business, it is time to consider the physical infrastruc-
ture. This applies to both retail and proprietary traders: Many pro-
prietary trading ﬁrms allow their members to trade remotely in their
homes. If you are a proprietary trader who requires minimal coach-
ing from your account manager and are conﬁdent in your ability to
set up the physical trading infrastructure yourself, there is no reason
not to trade remotely.
In the start-up phase of your business, the physical infrastruc-
ture can be light and simple. You probably have all the compo-
nents you need in your home ofﬁce already: a good personal com-
puter (practically any new computer with dual-core processors will
do), a high-speed (DSL or cable) Internet connection, and, less well
known, an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) so that your com-
puter doesn’t get accidentally shut down in the middle of a trade be-
cause of electricity ﬂuctuations. The total initial investment should
not exceed a couple of thousand dollars at the maximum, and the
monthly cost should not be more than $50 or so if you don’t already
subscribe to cable TV.
Some traders wonder if having a TV tuned to CNBC or CNN
is a good idea. While it certainly won’t hurt, many professional
quantitative traders have found that it is not necessary, as long as
they also subscribe to another professional real-time newsfeed, such
as Thomson Reuters, Dow Jones, or Bloomberg. While Bloomberg
can cost almost $2,000 a month, various plans offered by Thomson
Reuters and Dow Jones can cost as little as $100 to $200 (though
some will require an annual contract). Bloomberg also has a free
Internet radio stream at www.bloomberg.com/tvradio/radio that an-
nounces breaking business news and commentaries. Also, instead


<!-- PAGE 98 -->

76
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
of installing a TV in your ofﬁce, you can subscribe to CNBC Plus,
which will provide live streaming video to your computer. Of course,
too much real-time information may not necessarily lead to more
proﬁtable trades. For example, Michael Mauboussin of Legg Mason
cites a study that ﬁnds horse-racing handicappers less successful in
their predictions when they are given more information when rank-
ing horses. (See Economist, 2007a, or Oldﬁeld, 2007.)
As your trading business grows, you may upgrade your infra-
structure gradually. Perhaps you will purchase faster computers. A
quad-core computer at the time of this writing is considered fairly
high end. Of course, when you are reading this, an octal-core or bet-
ter personal computer will probably be widely available. According
to a New York Times article (Markoff, 2007), PCs with octal-core
chips will be available as soon as 2010.
You will certainly want to purchase multiple monitors to hook
up to the same computer so that you have extended screen space
to monitor all the different trading applications and portfolios.
Maybe you will want to upgrade your Internet connection to a T1
line, too. As discussed in Chapter 2, any delay in the transmis-
sion of your order to your brokerage results in slippage, which
is quite real in terms of lost proﬁts. In fast-moving markets, ev-
ery millisecond counts, and an upgrade in your Internet connection
speed may well pay for itself very quickly. (A T1 line can cost any-
where from $700 to $1,500, whereas a cable/DSL connection is usu-
ally under $50. A T1 line transmits information at 1.5Mbps, where
bps means “bits per second,” about twice as fast as a cable/DSL
connection.)
Once you have ﬁnally tested your trading strategy and discover
that it works in practice very well, it will be time to scale up the
business and consider “business continuity planning” so that your
trading strategy is resilient to common household disasters such as
Internet outage, electricity outage, ﬂooding, and so on. You can in-
stall your trading programs on a remote server located in a hosting
company; in fact, you can even “collocate” your computers contain-
ing your trading programs at the hosting company. (Having your
programs hosted or having your servers collocated will cost you


<!-- PAGE 99 -->

Setting Up Your Business
77
anywhere from hundreds to over a thousand dollars a month.) You
can monitor, maintain, or update your trading programs running on
these servers remotely through common remote PC applications
such as GotoMyPC (about $15 a month), while the remote servers
will be sending orders directly to your brokerage. The advantage
of this setup is not only that your trading will almost never have
downtime, but that the Internet connection at the hosting company
is likely to be faster than what you have at home or in your ofﬁce. In
fact, for some ultra-high-frequency trading applications, it is advan-
tageous to locate your servers near an Internet backbone as close as
possible to the exchange on which your trades will be executed. Just
Google the phrases “server hosting” or “collocation servers” and you
will ﬁnd numerous hosting ﬁrms offering such services.
SUMMARY
This chapter focused on those decisions and steps that you need to
take to bridge the research phase and the execution phase of your
trading business. I have covered the pros and cons of retail trading
versus proprietary trading and the issues to consider in choosing a
brokerage or proprietary trading ﬁrm.
In a nutshell, retail brokerages give you complete freedom and
better capital protection but smaller leverage, while proprietary
trading ﬁrms give you less freedom and less capital protection but
much high leverage. Finding a suitable retail brokerage is relatively
easy. It took me less than a month to research and settle on one and
I have not found a reason to switch yet. Finding a suitable propri-
etary trading ﬁrm is much more involved, since there are contracts
to sign and an exam (Series 7) to pass. It took me several months to
get my account set up at one.
Of course, you can choose to have both retail and proprietary
accounts, each tailored to the speciﬁc needs of your strategies. This
way, you can also easily compare their speed of execution and depth
of liquidity.


<!-- PAGE 100 -->

78
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Regardless of whether you have chosen to trade in a retail bro-
kerage or join a proprietary trading ﬁrm, you need to make sure their
trading account and systems have these features:
r Relatively low commissions.
r Trade a good variety of ﬁnancial instruments.
r Access to deep pool of liquidity.
r Most importantly, API for real-time data retrieval and order
transmission.
I also described the progressive buildup of the physical infra-
structure you need to build in order to run a trading business. Some
of the components of a trader’s operating environment mentioned
are:
r A dual-core or quad-core computer.
r A high-speed Internet connection (cable, DSL, or T1).
r A noninterruptible power supply.
r Real-time data and news feed and subscription to ﬁnancial TV
news channels.
r Server hosting or collocation.
Building out the physical trading infrastructure is actually quite
easy, since in the beginning you probably have all the components
ready in your home ofﬁce already. I have found that it is easy to
trade a million-dollar portfolio with nothing more than a few thou-
sand dollars’ initial investment in your physical infrastructure, and
a few hundred dollars a month in operating cost. But if you want to
increase your trading capacity or improve your returns, additional
incremental investments will be needed.
Once you have considered and taken these steps, you are now
positioned to build an automated trading environment to execute
your strategy, which will be covered in the next chapter.

A
t this point, you should have backtested a good strategy
(maybe something like the pair-trading strategy in Example
3.6), picked a brokerage (e.g., Interactive Brokers), and have
set up a good operating environment (at ﬁrst, nothing more than a
computer, a high-speed Internet connection, and a real-time news-
feed). You are almost ready to execute your trading strategy—after
you have implemented an automated trading system (ATS) to gener-
ate and transmit your orders to your brokerage for execution. This
chapter is about building such an automated trading system and
ways to minimize trading costs and divergence with your expected
performance based on your backtests.
WHAT AN AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEM
CAN DO FOR YOU
An automated trading system will retrieve up-to-date market data
from your brokerage or other data vendors, run a trading algo-
rithm to generate orders, and submit those orders to your broker-
age for execution. Sometimes, all these steps are fully automated
and implemented as one desktop application installed on your com-
puter. Other times, only part of this process is automated, and
79

you would have to take some manual steps to complete the whole
procedure.
A fully automated system has the advantage that it minimizes hu-
man errors and delays. For certain high-frequency systems, a fully
automated system is indispensable, because any human interven-
tion will cause enough delay to seriously derail the performance.
However, a fully automated system is also complicated and costly
to build, often requiring professional programmers with knowledge
of high-performance programming languages such as Java, C#, or
C++ in order to connect to your brokerage’s application program-
ming interface (API).
For lower-frequency quantitative trading strategies, there is a
semiautomated alternative: One can generate the orders using pro-
grams such as Excel or MATLAB, then submit those orders using
built-in tools such as a basket trader or spread trader offered by your
brokerage. If your brokerage provides a dynamic data exchange
(DDE) link to Excel (see below), you can also write a macro at-
tached to your Excel spreadsheet that allows you to submit orders
to the brokerage simply by running the macro. This way, there is
no need to build an application in a complicated programming lan-
guage. However, it does mean that you would have to perform quite
a few manual steps in order to submit your orders.
Whether you have built a semiautomated or a fully automated
trading system, there is often a need for input data beyond the prices
that your brokerage or data vendor can readily provide you. For ex-
ample, earnings estimates or dividends data are often not provided
as part of the real-time data stream. These nonprice data are typ-
ically available free of charge from many web sites, but are usu-
ally embedded in an HTML format and not readily usable. Hence,
an automated system also must be able to retrieve such web pages,
parse them, and reformat them into a tabular format that your trad-
ing strategy can utilize. Such web page retrieval and parsing pro-
grams can readily be implemented in MATLAB (see Example 3.1 in
Chapter 3), or in other scripting languages such as Perl.
I will discuss some details of the two kinds of system in the
following sections. I will also discuss how to hire a programming

consultant in case you would like someone to help automate the ex-
ecution of your trading strategy.
Building a Semiautomated Trading System
In a semiautomated trading system (shown in Figure 5.1), a user
typically generates a list of orders using familiar and easy-to-use
software such as Excel or MATLAB. Often, the program that gen-
erates this order list is the same as the backtest program: After all,
you are implementing the same quantitative strategy that you have
backtested. Of course, you must remember to update the input data
ﬁle to reﬂect the most recent data. This is usually done with either
a MATLAB program that can directly go to a web site to retrieve
the appropriate data, or with a separate program such as HQuote,
mentioned earlier, which can download en masse historical price
data for a large number of symbols. In the latter case, MATLAB is
used only to organize those data in a suitable format for the trading
strategy program that generates today’s orders.
The data update step is easy when the most recent data is the
previous day’s close, but certainly more difﬁcult when it is the last
intraday price. When the data required is the last price, your data
vendor or brokerage must provide a DDE link that automatically

updates an Excel input ﬁle. Most brokerages that cater to serious
traders provide such DDE links. Interactive Brokers, Genesis Secu-
rities, and Goldman Sachs’s REDIPlus are some of the examples.
Many proprietary trading ﬁrms use one of these brokerages for ex-
ecution; hence, you would have access to the full menu of these
brokerages’ real-time data and order entry technologies as well.
A DDE link is just an expression to be inserted on an Excel
spreadsheet that will automatically load the appropriate data into
a cell. The expression is different for different brokerages, but they
generally look like this:
=accountid|LAST!IBM
where LAST indicates the last price is requested, and IBM is the sym-
bol in question.
To generate the orders, you can run an Excel macro (a Visual
Basic program attached to the spreadsheet) or a MATLAB program,
which scans through the information and prices on the spreadsheet,
runs the trading algorithm, and writes out the orders to another text
ﬁle where each line contains the triplet (symbol, side, size). For ex-
ample,
("IBM", "BUY", "100")
may be a line in the output order ﬁle. Sometimes, your brokerage re-
quires other information for order submission, such as whether the
order is Day only, or Good Till Cancel. All this auxiliary information
is written out to each line of the order ﬁle.
After the text ﬁle containing the order list is generated, you
can then upload this order ﬁle to your brokerage’s basket trader or
spread trader for submission.
A basket trader is an application that allows you to upload multi-
ple orders for multiple symbols and submit them to the brokerage in
one keystroke. Spread trader is an application with which you can
specify the symbols of multiple pairs of stocks or other securities,
and the conditions when orders for each of these pairs should be
entered. The spread trader can monitor real-time prices and check
whether these conditions are satisﬁed throughout the trading day.


<!-- PAGE 105 -->

Execution Systems
83
If the DDE links of your brokerage allow you to submit orders, you
can also run an Excel macro to sweep through the order ﬁle and
submit all the orders to your account with one press of the button
as well.
The two brokerages that I use, Interactive Brokers and
REDIPlus, have basket trader and spread trader, as well as DDE
links for data update and order submission as part of their execu-
tion platform. (Interactive Brokers’ spread trader can be used only
for futures calendar spreads. Stock spreads can be speciﬁed one pair
at a time through their so-called “Generic Combo,” though the con-
tinuous monitoring of order entry condition works for both futures
and stocks.)
Here is what I do with a basket trader from Interactive Brokers.
Every day before the market opens I run a MATLAB program that
retrieves market data, run the trading algorithm, and write out a list
of orders into an order ﬁle that can be over 1,000 lines (correspond-
ing to over 1,000 symbols). I then bring up the basket trader from my
trading screen, upload the order ﬁle to my account using the basket
trader, and in one keystroke submit them all to my account. Some
of these orders may get executed at the open; others may get exe-
cuted later or not at all. Before the market closes, I cancel all the
unexecuted orders by pressing a button. Finally, if I want to exit all
the existing positions, I simply press another button in the basket
trader to generate the appropriate exit orders.
I use REDIPlus’s spread trader for pair-trading strategies such
as Example 3.6 because I can have the spread trader enter orders at
all times of the day, not just at the market close. Again, before the
market opens I use MATLAB to retrieve market data, run the pair-
trading algorithm, and write out limit prices for all the pairs in my
universe. (Note that the limit prices are limits on the spread, not on
the individual stocks. If they were on the individual stocks, ordinary
limit orders would have done the trick and the spread trader would
have been redundant.) I then go to the spread trader, which already
contains all these pairs that I have previously speciﬁed, and manu-
ally adjust the limit prices based on the MATLAB output. (Actually,
this step can be automated too—all the spread orders information
can be written out to an Excel ﬁle by MATLAB and uploaded to the


<!-- PAGE 106 -->

84
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
spread trader.) Pressing another button will initiate automatic mon-
itoring of prices and entering of orders throughout the trading day.
I also use RediPlus’s DDE link for submitting orders for another
basket trading strategy. I use MATLAB to generate the appropri-
ate DDE link formula in each Excel cell so that it can automati-
cally update the appropriate data for the particular symbol on that
row. After the market opens, I run a macro attached to that spread-
sheet, which scans through each symbol and submits it (together
with other order information contained in the spreadsheet) to my
account at REDIPlus.
Typically, a semiautomated trading system is suitable if you
need to run this step only a few times a day in order to generate
one or a few waves of orders. Even if your brokerage’s API provides
an order submission function for your use in an Excel Visual Basic
macro, its speed is usually too slow if you have to run this program
frequently in order to capture the latest data and generate wave af-
ter wave of orders. In this case, one must build a fully automated
trading system.
Building a Fully Automated Trading System
A fully automated trading system (see Figure 5.2) can run the trading
algorithm in a loop again and again, constantly scanning the latest
prices and generating new waves of orders throughout the trading
day. The submission of orders through an API to your brokerage
account is automatic, so you would not need to load the trades to
a basket trader or spread trader, or even manually run a macro on

your Excel spreadsheet. All you need to do is press a “start” button
in the morning, and then a “close” button at the end of the day, and
your program will do all the trading for you.
Implementing a fully automated system requires that your bro-
kerage provides an API for data retrieval and order submission. Your
brokerage will usually provide API for some popular programming
languages such as Visual Basic, Java, C#, or C++, so your fully auto-
mated system must also be written in one of these languages. Unfor-
tunately, no brokerage that I know of provides an API for MATLAB.
Hence, MATLAB cannot be used to build the order transmission por-
tion of an automated trading system.
Theoretically, a fully automated system can be constructed out
of an Excel spreadsheet and an attached macro: All you have to
do is to create a loop in your macro so that it updates the cells
using the DDE links and submit orders when appropriate contin-
uously throughout the day. Unfortunately, data updates through
DDE links are slow, and generally your brokerage limits the num-
ber of symbols that you can update all at once. (Unless you have
generated a large amount of commissions in the previous trading
month, Interactive Brokers allows you to update only 100 sym-
bols by default.) Similarly, order submissions through DDE links
are also slow. Hence, for trading strategies that react to real-time
market data changes intraday, this setup using a spreadsheet is not
feasible.
There are some brokerages such as TradeStation that offer a
complete backtesting and order submission platform. If you back-
tested on such a platform, then it is trivial to conﬁgure it so that
the program will submit real orders to your account. This dispenses
with the need to write your own software, whether for backtesting
or for automated execution. However, as I mentioned in Chapter 3,
the drawback of such proprietary systems is that they are seldom as
ﬂexible as a general-purpose programming language like MATLAB
or Java for the construction of your strategy. For instance, if you
want to pursue a rather mathematically complex strategy based on
principal component analysis (such as the one in Example 7.4), it
would be quite difﬁcult to backtest in TradeStation. More advanced
integrated trading platforms such as Alphacet’s Discovery do


<!-- PAGE 108 -->

86

provide a much larger variety of algorithms to be backtested and
implemented, but they may not be affordable to the typical indepen-
dent trader.

C O N S U L T A N T
Building an ATS generally requires more professional programming skills than
backtesting a strategy. This is especially true for high-frequency strategies
where the speed of execution is of the essence. Instead of implementing an
execution system yourself, you may ﬁnd that hiring a programming consultant
will result in much less headache.
Hiring a programming consultant does not have to be expensive. For an
experienced programmer, the hourly fees may range from $50 to $100. Some-
times, you can negotiate a ﬁxed fee for the entire project ahead of time, and
I ﬁnd that most projects for independent traders can be done with $1,000 to
$5,000. If you have an account at one of the brokerages that supply you with
an API, the brokerage can often refer you to some programmers who have ex-
perience with their API. (Interactive Brokers, for example, has a special web
page that allows programming consultants to oﬀer their services.) You can also
look around (or post a request) on elitetrader.com for such programmers. As a
last resort, you can ﬁnd hundreds if not thousands of freelance programmers
advertising themselves on craigslist.org. However, I ﬁnd that the quality of free-
lance programmers on craigslist can be uneven—in particular, they usually lack
in-depth knowledge of ﬁnancial markets and trading technology, which can be
crucial to successfully implementing an automated trading system.
There is one issue that may worry you as you consider hiring programmers:
How do you keep your trading strategy conﬁdential? Of course, you can have
them sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs, downloadable for free at many
legal document web sites), but it is almost impossible to ﬁnd out if the pro-
grammers are in fact running your strategies in their personal accounts once
the programs are implemented. There are several ways to address this concern.
First, as I mentioned before, most strategies that you may think are your
unique creations are actually quite well known to experienced traders. So,
whether you like it or not, other people are already trading very similar strategies
and impacting your returns. Adding an extra trader or two, unless the trader
works for an institutional money manager, is not likely to cause much more
impact.
Second, if you are trading a strategy that has a large capacity (e.g., most
futures trading strategies), then the extra market impact from your rogue pro-
grammer consultant will be minimal.
Finally, you can choose to compartmentalize your information and
implementation—that is, you can hire diﬀerent programmers to build diﬀerent
parts of the automated trading strategy. Often, one programmer can build an


<!-- PAGE 109 -->

Execution Systems
87
automated trading infrastructure program that can be used for diﬀerent strate-
gies, and another one can implement the actual strategy, which will read in input
parameters. So in this case, the ﬁrst programmer does not know your strategy,
and the second programmer does not have the infrastructure to execute the
strategy. Furthermore, neither programmer knows the actual parameter values
to use for your strategy.
MINIMIZING TRANSACTION COSTS
We saw in Chapter 3 how transaction costs can impact a strategy’s
actual return. Besides changing your brokerage or proprietary trad-
ing ﬁrm to one that charges a lower commission, there are a few
things you can do in your execution method to minimize the trans-
action costs.
To cut down on commissions, you can refrain from trading low-
price stocks. Typically, institutional traders do not trade any stocks
with prices lower than $5. Not only do low-price stocks increase
your total commissions costs (since you need to buy or sell more
shares for a ﬁxed amount of capital), percentage-wise they also have
a wider bid-ask spread and therefore increase your total liquidity
costs.
In order to minimize market impact cost, you should limit the
size (number of shares) of your orders based on the liquidity of the
stock. One common measure of liquidity is the average daily volume
(it is your choice what lookback period you want to average over).
As a rule of thumb, each order should not exceed 1 percent of the
average daily volume. As an independent trader, you may think that
it is not easy to reach this 1 percent threshold, and you would be
right when the stock in question is a large-cap stock belonging to
the S&P 500. However, you may be surprised by the low liquidity of
some small-cap stocks out there.
For example, at the time of this writing, IRN is a stock in the S&P
600 SmallCap Index. It has a three-month average volume of about
51,000, and it closed today at $4.45. So 1 percent of this average
volume is just 510 shares, which are worth only $2,269!
Another way to reduce market impact is to scale the size of your
orders based on the market capitalization of a stock. The way to


<!-- PAGE 110 -->

88
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
scale the size is not an exact science, but most practitioners would
not recommend a linear scale because the market capitalization of
companies varies over several orders of magnitude, from tens of mil-
lions to hundreds of billions. A linear scale (i.e., scaling the capital
of a stock to be linearly proportional to its market capitalization)
would result in practically zero weights for most small- and micro-
cap stocks in your portfolio, and this will take away any beneﬁts of
diversiﬁcation. If we were to use linear scale, the capital weight of
the largest large-cap stock will be about 10,000 of the smallest small-
cap stock. To reap the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation, we should not al-
low that ratio to be more than 10 or so, provided that the liquidity
(volume) constraint described above is also satisﬁed. If the capital
weight of a stock is proportional to the fourth root of its market cap,
it would do the trick.
There is one other way to reduce market impact. Many insti-
tutional traders who desire to execute a large order will break it
down into many smaller orders and execute them over time. This
method of trading will certainly reduce market impact; however,
it engenders another kind of transactions costs, namely, slippage.
As discussed in Chapter 2, slippage is the difference between the
price that triggers the trading signal and the average execution price
of the entire order. Because the order is executed over a period
of time, slippage can be quite large. Since reducing market impact
in this way may increase slippage, it is not really suitable for retail
traders whose order size is usually not big enough to require this
remedy.
Sometimes, however, slippage is outside of your control: Per-
haps your brokerage’s execution speed is simply too slow, due to
either software issues (their software processes your orders too
slowly), risk control issues (your order has to be checked against
your account’s buying power and pass various risk control criteria
before it can be routed to the exchange), or pipeline issues (the bro-
kerage’s speed of access to the exchanges). Or perhaps your bro-
kerage does not have access to deep enough “dark-pool” liquidity.
These execution costs and issues should affect your choice of bro-
kerages, as I pointed out in Chapter 4.

TESTING YOUR SYSTEM BY
PAPER TRADING
After you have built your automated trading system, it is a good idea
to test it in a paper trading account, if your brokerage provides one.
Paper trading has a number of beneﬁts; chief among them is that
this is practically the only way to see if your ATS software has bugs
without losing a lot of real money.
Often, the moment you start paper trading you will realize that
there is a glaring look-ahead bias in your strategy—there may just be
no way you could have obtained some crucial piece of data before
you enter an order! If this happens, it is “back to the drawing board.”
You should be able run your ATS, execute paper trades, and then
compare the paper trades and proﬁt and loss (P&L) with the theoret-
ical ones generated by your backtest program using the latest data.
If the difference is not due to transaction costs (including an ex-
pected delay in execution for the paper trades), then your software
likely has bugs. (I mentioned the names of some of the brokerages
that offer paper trading accounts in Chapter 4.)
Another beneﬁt of paper trading is that it gives you better in-
tuitive understanding of your strategy, including the volatility of its
P&L, the typical amount of capital utilized, the number of trades per
day, and the various operational difﬁculties including data issues.
Even though you can theoretically check out most of these features
of your strategy in a backtest, one will usually gain intuition only if
one faces them on a daily, ongoing basis. Backtesting also won’t re-
veal the operational difﬁculties, such as how fast you can download
all the needed data before the market opens each day and how you
can optimize your operational procedures in actual execution.
(Do not underestimate the time required for preparing your or-
ders before the market opens. It took me some 20 minutes to down-
load and parse all my historical data each morning, and it took an-
other 15 minutes or so to transmit all the orders to my account. If
your trading strategy depends on data or news prior to the market
open that cannot be more than 35 minutes old, then you need to
either ﬁgure out a different execution environment or modify your


<!-- PAGE 112 -->

90
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
strategy. It is hard to ﬁgure out all these timing issues until paper
trading is conducted.)
If you are able to run a paper trading system for a month or
longer, you may even be able to discover data-snooping bias, since
paper trading is a true out-of-sample test. However, traders usually
pay less and less attention to the performance of a paper trading
system as time goes on, since there are always more pressing issues
(such as the real trading programs that are being run). This inatten-
tion causes the paper trading system to perform poorly because of
neglect and errors in operation. So data-snooping bias can usually
be discovered only when you have actually started trading the sys-
tem with a small amount of capital.
WHY DOES ACTUAL PERFORMANCE
DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS?
Finally, after much hard work testing and preparing, you have en-
tered your ﬁrst order and it got executed! Whether you win or lose,
you understand that it will take a while to ﬁnd out if its performance
meets your expectations. But what if after one month, then two
months, and then ﬁnally a quarter has passed, the strategy still de-
livers a meager or maybe even negative returns. This disappointing
experience is common to freshly minted quantitative traders. This
would be the time to review the list of what possibly may have
caused this divergence from expectation. Start with the simplest
diagnosis:
r Do you have bugs in your ATS software?
r Do the trades generated by your ATS match the ones generated
by your backtest program?
r Are the execution costs much higher than what you expected?
r Are you trading illiquid stocks that caused a lot of market im-
pact?
If the execution costs are much higher than what you expected,
it may be worthwhile to reread the section on how to minimize trans-
action costs again.


<!-- PAGE 113 -->

91
After these easy diagnoses have been eliminated, one is then
faced with the two most dreaded causes of divergence: data-
snooping bias and regime shifts.
To see if data-snooping bias is causing the underperformance
of your live trading, try to eliminate as many rules and as many pa-
rameters in your strategy as possible. If the backtest performance
completely fell apart after this exercise, chances are you do have
this bias and it is time to look for a new strategy. If the backtest
performance is still reasonable, your poor live trading performance
may just be due to bad luck.
Regime shifts refer to the situation when the ﬁnancial market
structure or the macroeconomic environment undergoes a drastic
change so much so that trading strategies that were proﬁtable be-
fore may not be proﬁtable now.
There are two noteworthy regime shifts in recent years re-
lated to market (or regulatory) structure that may affect certain
strategies.
The ﬁrst one is the decimalization of stock prices. Prior to early
2001, stock prices in the United States were quoted in multiples of
one-sixteenth and one-eighteenth of a penny. Since April 9, 2001, all
U.S. stocks have been quoted in decimals. This seemingly innocuous
change has had a dramatic impact on the market structure, which
is particularly negative for the proﬁtability of statistical arbitrage
strategies.
The reason for this may be worthy of a book unto itself. In a
nutshell, decimalization reduces frictions in the price discovery pro-
cess, while statistical arbitrageurs mostly act as market makers and
derive their proﬁts from frictions and inefﬁciencies in this process.
(This is the explanation given by Dr. Andrew Sterge in a Columbia
University ﬁnancial engineering seminar titled “Where Have All the
Stat Arb Proﬁts Gone?” in January 2008. Other industry practitioners
have made the same point to me in private conversations.) Hence,
we can expect backtest performance of statistical arbitrage strate-
gies prior to 2001 to be far superior to their present-day perfor-
mance.
The other regime shift is relevant if your strategy shorts
stocks.


<!-- PAGE 114 -->

92
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Prior to 2007, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules
state that one cannot short a stock unless it is on a “plus tick” or
“zero-plus tick.” Hence, if your backtest data include those earlier
days, it is possible that a very proﬁtable short position could not ac-
tually have been entered into due to a lack of plus ticks, or it could
have been entered into only with a large slippage. This plus-tick rule
was eliminated by the SEC in June 2007. Therefore, your backtest
results for a strategy that shorts stocks may show an artiﬁcially in-
ﬂated performance prior to 2007 relative to their actual realizable
performance in those days.
Actually, there is another problem with realizing the backtest
performance of a strategy that shorts stocks apart from this regula-
tory regime shift. Even without the plus-tick rule, many stocks, es-
pecially the small-cap ones or the ones with low liquidity, are “hard
to borrow.” For you to be able to short a stock, your broker has to
be able to borrow it from someone else (usually a large mutual fund
or other brokerage clients) and lend it to you for selling. If no one is
able or willing to lend you their stock, it is deemed hard to borrow
and you would not be able to short it. Hence, again, a very proﬁtable
historical short position may not actually have been possible due to
the difﬁculty of borrowing the stock.
The two regime shifts described here are the obvious and well-
publicized ones. However, there may be other, more subtle regime
shifts that apply to your category of stocks that few people know
about, but is no less disruptive to the proﬁtability of your strategy’s
performance. I will discuss how one might come up with a model
that detects regime shifts automatically as one of the special topics
of Chapter 7.
SUMMARY
An automated trading system is a piece of software that automat-
ically generates and transmits orders to your brokerage account
based on your trading strategy. The advantages of having this soft-
ware are that:


<!-- PAGE 115 -->

Execution Systems
93
r It ensures the faithful adherence to your backtested strategy.
r It eliminates manual operation so that you can simultaneously
run multiple strategies.
r Most importantly, it allows speedy transmissions of orders,
which is essential to high-frequency trading strategies.
Regarding the difference between a semiautomated trading sys-
tem and a fully automated trading system:
r In a semiautomated trading system, the trader still needs to man-
ually upload a text ﬁle containing order details to a basket trader
or spread trader, and manually press a button to transmit the or-
ders at the appropriate time. However, the order text ﬁle can be
automatically generated by a program such as MATLAB.
r In a fully automated trading system, the program will be able to
automatically upload data and transmit orders throughout the
trading day or even over many days.
After the creation of an ATS, you can then focus on the various
issues that are important in execution: minimizing transaction costs
and paper trading. Minimizing transaction costs is mainly a matter
of not allowing your order size to be too big relative to its average
trading volume and relative to its market capitalization. Paper trad-
ing allows you to:
r Discover software bugs in your trading strategy and execution
programs.
r Discover look-ahead or even data-snooping bias.
r Discover operating difﬁculties and plan for operating schedules.
r Estimate transaction costs more realistically.
r Gain important intuition about P&L volatility, capital usage,
portfolio size, and trade frequency.
Finally, what do you do in the situation where your live trading
underperforms your backtest? You can start by addressing the usual


<!-- PAGE 116 -->

94
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
problems: Eliminate bugs in the strategy or execution software; re-
duce transaction costs; and simplify the strategy by eliminating pa-
rameters. But, fundamentally, your strategy still may have suffered
from data-snooping bias or regime shift.
If you believe (and you can only believe, as you can never prove
this) that your poor live trading performance is due to bad luck and
not to data-snooping bias in your backtest nor to a regime shift, how
should you proceed when the competing demands of perseverance
and capital preservation seem to suggest opposite actions? This crit-
ical issue will be addressed in the next chapter, which discusses sys-
tematic ways to preserve capital in the face of losses and yet still be
in a position to recover once the tide turns.

A
ll trading strategies suffer occasional losses, technically
known as drawdowns. The drawdowns may last a few min-
utes or a few years. To proﬁt from a quantitative trading busi-
ness, it is essential to manage your risks in a way that limits your
drawdowns to a tolerable level and yet be positioned to use opti-
mal leverage of your equity to achieve maximum possible growth of
your wealth. Furthermore, if you have more than one strategy, you
will also need to ﬁnd a way to optimally allocate capital among them
so as to maximize overall risk-adjusted return.
The optimal allocation of capital and the optimal leverage to use
so as to strike the right balance between risk management and max-
imum growth is the focus of this chapter, and the central tool we
use is called the Kelly formula.
OPTIMAL CAPITAL ALLOCATION
AND LEVERAGE
Suppose you plan to trade several strategies, each with their own
expected returns and standard deviations. How should you allocate
capital among them in an optimal way? Furthermore, what should
be the overall leverage (ratio of the size of your portfolio to your

account equity)? Dr. Edward Thorp, whom I mentioned in the pref-
ace, has written an excellent expository article on this subject in one
of his papers (Thorp, 1997), and I shall follow his discussion closely
in this chapter. (Dr. Thorp’s discussion is centered on a portfolio of
securities, and mine is constructed around a portfolio of strategies.
However, the mathematics are almost identical.)
Every optimization problem begins with an objective. Our ob-
jective here is to maximize our long-term wealth—an objective that
I believe is not controversial for the individual investor. Maximiz-
ing long-term wealth is equivalent to maximizing the long-term com-
pounded growth rate g of your portfolio. Note that this objective im-
plicitly means that ruin (i.e., equity’s going to zero or less because of
a loss) must be avoided. This is because if ruin can be reached with
nonzero probability at some point, the long-term wealth is surely
zero, as is the long-term growth rate.
(In all of the discussions, I assume that we reinvest all trading
proﬁts, and therefore it is the levered, compounded growth rate that
is of ultimate importance.)
One approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-
tribution of the returns of each of the trading strategy i is Gaussian,
with a ﬁxed mean mi and standard deviation si. (The returns should
be net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)
This is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite
inaccurate. Certain big losses in the ﬁnancial markets occur with
far higher frequencies (or viewed alternatively, at far higher magni-
tudes) than Gaussian probability distributions will allow. However,
every scientiﬁc or engineering endeavor starts with the simplest
model with the crudest approximation, and ﬁnance is no excep-
tion. I will discuss the remedies to such inaccuracies later in this
chapter.
Let’s denote the optimal fractions of your equity that you should
allocate to each of your n strategies by a column vector F∗= ( f ∗
1 ,
f ∗
2 , . . . , f ∗
n )T. Here, T means transpose.
Given our optimization objective and the Gaussian assumption,
Dr. Thorp has shown that the optimal allocation is given by
F∗= C−1M

Here, C is the covariance matrix such that matrix element Cij is
the covariance of the returns of the ith and jth strategies, −1 indi-
cates matrix inverse, and M = (m1, m2, . . . , mn)T is the column vec-
tor of mean returns of the strategies. Note that these returns are
one-period, simple (uncompounded), unlevered returns. For exam-
ple, if the strategy is long $1 of stock A and short $1 of stock B and
made $0.10 proﬁt in a period, m is 0.05, no matter what the equity in
the account is.
If we assume that the strategies are all statistically independent,
the covariance matrix becomes a diagonal matrix, with the diagonal
elements equal to the variance of the individual strategies. This leads
to an especially simple formula:
fi = mi/s2
i
This is the famous Kelly formula (for the many interesting stories
surrounding this formula, see, for example, Poundstone, 2005) as
applied to continuous ﬁnance as opposed to gambling with discrete
outcomes, and it gives the optimal leverage one should employ for a
particular trading strategy.
Interested readers can look up a simple derivation of Kelly for-
mula at the end of this chapter in the simple one-strategy case.
Example 6.1: An Interesting Puzzle (or Why Risk Is Bad for
You)*
Here is a little puzzle that may stymie many a professional trader. Sup-
pose a certain stock exhibits a true (geometric) random walk, by which
I mean there is a 50–50 chance that the stock is going up 1 percent or
down 1 percent every minute. If you buy this stock, are you most likely—in
the long run and ignoring ﬁnancing costs—to make money, lose money,
or be ﬂat?
Most traders will blurt out the answer “Flat!,” and that is wrong. The
correct answer is that you will lose money, at the rate of 0.005 percent (or
0.5 basis point) every minute! This is because for a geometric random walk,
the average compounded rate of return is not the short-term (or one-period)
return m (0 here), but is g = m −s2/2. This follows from the general formula
for compounded growth g(f ) given in the appendix to this chapter, with the
leverage f set to 1 and risk-free rate r set to 0. This is also consistent with


<!-- PAGE 120 -->

98
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
the fact that the geometric mean of a set of numbers is always smaller than
the arithmetic mean (unless the numbers are identical, in which case the
two means are the same). When we assume, as I did, that the arithmetic
mean of the returns is zero, the geometric mean, which gives the average
compounded rate of return, must be negative.
The take-away lesson here is that risk always decreases long-term
growth rate—hence the importance of risk management!
*This example was reproduced with corrections from my blog article “Maximizing
Compounded Rate of Return,” which you can ﬁnd at epchan.blogspot.com/2006/
10/maximizing-compounded-rate-of-return.html.
Often, because of uncertainties in parameter estimations, and
also because return distributions are not really Gaussian, traders
prefer to cut this recommended leverage in half for safety. This is
called “half-Kelly” betting.
If you have a retail trading account, your maximum overall lever-
age l will be restricted to either 2 or 4, depending on whether you
hold the positions overnight or just intraday. In this situation, you
would have to reduce each fi by the same factor l/(| f1| + | f2| +
· · · + | fn|), where | f1| + | f2| + · · · + | fn| is the total unrestricted
leverage of the portfolio. Here, we ignore the possibility that some of
your individual strategies may hold positions that offset each other
(such as a long and a short position each balanced with short and
long T-bills, respectively) which may allow you to hold a higher
leverage than this formula suggests.
I stated that adopting this capital allocation and leverage will al-
low us to maximize the long-term compounded growth rate of your
equity. So what is this maximum compounded growth rate? It turns
out to be
g = r + S2/2
where the S is none other than the Sharpe ratio of your portfolio! As
I mentioned in Chapter 2, the higher the Sharpe ratio of your portfo-
lio (or strategy), the higher the maximum growth rate of your equity


<!-- PAGE 121 -->

(or wealth), provided you use the optimal leverage recommended
by the Kelly formula. Here is the simple mathematical embodiment
of this fact.
Example 6.2: Calculating the Optimal Leverage Based on the
Kelly Formula
Let’s see an example of the Kelly formula at work. Suppose our portfolio
consists of just a long position in SPY, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) track-
ing the S&P 500 index. Let’s suppose that the mean annual return of SPY is
11.23 percent, with an annualized standard deviation of 16.91 percent, and
that the risk-free rate is 4 percent. Hence, the portfolio has an annual mean
excess return of 7.231 percent and an annual standard deviation of 16.91
percent, giving it a Sharpe ratio of 0.4275. The optimal leverage according
to the Kelly formula is f = 0.07231/0.16912 = 2.528. (Notice one inter-
esting tidbit: The Kelly f is independent of time scale, so it actually does
not matter whether you annualize your return and standard deviation, as
opposed to Sharpe ratio which is time scale dependent.) Finally, the annu-
alized compounded, levered growth rate is 13.14 percent, which includes
the ﬁnancing costs.
You can verify these numbers yourselves by downloading the SPY daily
prices from Yahoo! Finance and computing the various quantities on a
spreadsheet. I did that on December 29, 2007, and my spreadsheet is avail-
able at epchan.com/book/example6 2.xls. In column H, I have computed
the daily returns of the (adjusted) closing prices of SPY, while in row 3760
starting at column H, I have computed the (annualized) mean return of
SPY, the standard deviation of SPY, the mean excess return of the portfo-
lio, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, the Kelly leverage, and, ﬁnally, the
compounded growth rate.
The Kelly leverage of 2.528 that we computed is saying that, for this
strategy, if you have $100,000 in cash to invest, and if you really be-
lieve the expected values of your returns and standard deviations, you
should borrow money to buy $252,800 worth of SPY. Furthermore, ex-
pect an annual compounded return on your $100,000 investment to be
13.14 percent.
For comparison, let’s see what compounded growth rate we will get if
we did not leverage our investment (see the formula in the appendix to this
chapter): g = r + m−s2/2 = 0.1123 −(0.1691)2/2 = 9.8 percent. This, and
not mean annual return of 11.23 percent, is the long-term growth rate of
buying SPY with cash only.

Notice that the mean excess return of RTH is negative. Given this, it is
not surprising that the Kelly formula recommends we short RTH.
You might wonder what the Sharpe ratio and the maximum com-
pounded growth rate generated using this optimal allocation are. It turns
out that the maximum growth rate of a multistrategy Gaussian process is
g(F ∗) = r + F ∗TCF ∗/2
and the Sharpe ratio is given by
S =
√
F ∗TCF ∗

Notice that the compounded growth rate of the portfolio is 15.29 per-
cent, higher than that of the maximum growth rate achievable by any of
the individual stocks. (As an exercise, you can verify that the compounded
growth rate of OIH, which has the highest one-period return among the
three stocks, is 12.78 percent.)
Note that following the Kelly formula requires you to continu-
ously adjust your capital allocation as your equity changes so that
it remains optimal. Based on the SPY example (6.2), let’s say you
followed the Kelly formula and bought a portfolio worth $252,800.
The next day, disaster struck, and you lost 10 percent on the SPY.
So now your portfolio is worth only $227,520, and your equity is now
only $74,720. What should you do now? Kelly’s criterion will dictate


<!-- PAGE 125 -->

Money and Risk Management
103
that you immediately reduce the size of your portfolio to $188,892.
Why? Because the optimal leverage of 2.528 times the current equity
of $74,720 is $188,892.
As a practical procedure, this continuous updating of the capi-
tal allocation should occur at least once at the end of each trading
day. In addition to updating the capital allocation, one should also
periodically update F* itself by recalculating the most recent trail-
ing mean return and standard deviation. What should the lookback
period be and how often do you need to update these inputs to the
Kelly formula? These depend on the average holding period of your
strategy. If you hold your positions for only one day or so, then as a
rule of thumb, I would advise using a lookback period of six months.
Using a relatively short lookback period has the advantage of allow-
ing you to gradually reduce your exposure to strategies that have
been losing their performance. As for the frequency of update, it
should not be a burden to update F* daily once you have written a
program to do so.
One last point: Some strategies generate a variable number of
trading signals each day, which may result in a variable number of
positions and thus total capital each day. How should the Kelly for-
mula be used to determine the capital in this case when we don’t
know what it will be beforehand? One can still use the Kelly for-
mula to determine the maximum number of positions and thus the
maximum capital allowed. It is always safer to have a leverage be-
low what the Kelly formula recommends.
RISK MANAGEMENT
We saw in the previous section that the Kelly formula is not only
useful for the optimal allocation of capital and for the determination
of the optimal leverage, but also for risk management. In fact, the
SPY example (6.2) illustrated that the Kelly formula would advise
you to reduce the portfolio size in the face of trading losses. This
selling at a loss is the frequent result of risk management, whether
or not the risk management scheme is based on Kelly’s formula.


<!-- PAGE 126 -->

104
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Risk management always dictates that you should reduce your
position size whenever there is a loss, even when it means realizing
those losses. (The other face of the coin is that optimal leverage dic-
tates that you should increase your position size when your strategy
generates proﬁts.) This kind of selling is believed by some analysts
to be the cause of “ﬁnancial contagion” affecting many large hedge
funds simultaneously when one faces a large loss.
An example of this is the summer 2007 meltdown, described in
the previously cited article “What Happened to the Quants in Au-
gust 2007?” by Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. During August 2007,
under the ominous cloud of a housing and mortgage default crisis,
a number of well-known hedge funds experienced unprecedented
losses, with Goldman Sachs’s Global Alpha fund falling 22.5 per-
cent. Several billion dollars evaporated within all of one week. Even
Renaissance Technologies Corporation, arguably the most success-
ful quantitative hedge fund of all time, lost 8.7 percent in the ﬁrst
half of August, though it later recovered most of it. Not only is the
magnitude of the loss astounding, but the widespread nature of it
was causing great concern in the ﬁnancial community. Strangest of
all, few of these funds hold any mortgage-backed securities at all,
ostensibly the root cause of the panic. It therefore became a classic
study of ﬁnancial contagion as propagated by hedge funds.
This kind of contagion occurs because a large loss by one hedge
fund causes it to sell off some large positions that it holds (whether
or not these are the positions that cause the loss in the ﬁrst place).
This selling causes the prices of the securities to drop (or rise in
the case of short positions). If other hedge funds are holding sim-
ilar positions, they will then suffer large losses also, causing their
own risk management system to sell off their own positions, and on
and on. For example, in the summer of 2007, one large hedge fund
might have been holding subprime mortgage-backed securities and
suffered a large loss in that sector. Risk management then required
that it sold off liquid stock positions in their portfolio which might,
up to that point, be unaffected by the subprime debacle. Because of
the selling of such stock positions, other statistical arbitrage hedge
funds that hold no mortgage-backed securities might now suffered
big losses, and proceeded to sell their stocks as well. Hence, a


<!-- PAGE 127 -->

Money and Risk Management
105
sell-off in the mortgage-backed securities market suddenly became
a sell-off in the stock market—a nice demonstration of the meaning
of contagion.
Given the necessity of realizing losses as well as the scale and
frequency of trading required to constantly rebalance the portfolio
in order to closely follow the Kelly formula, it is understandable that
most traders prefer to trade at half-Kelly leverage. A lower leverage
implies a smaller size of the selling required for risk management.
Sometimes, even taking the conservative half-Kelly formula may
be too aggressive, and traders may want to limit their portfolio
size further by additional constraints. This is because, as I pointed
out previously, the application of the Kelly formula to continuous
ﬁnance is premised on the assumption that return distribution is
Gaussian. (Finance is continuous in the sense that the outcomes of
making bets in the ﬁnancial market fall on a continuum of proﬁts or
losses, as opposed to a game of cards where the outcomes fall into
discrete cases.) But, of course, the returns are not really Gaussian:
large losses occur at far higher frequencies than would be predicted
by a nice bell-shaped curve. Some people refer to the true distri-
butions of returns as having “fat tails.” What this means is that the
probability of an event far, far away from the mean is much higher
than allowed by the Gaussian bell curve. These highly improbable
events have been called “black swan” events by the author Nassim
Taleb (see Taleb, 2007).
To handle extreme events that fall outside the Gaussian distri-
bution, we can use our simple backtest technique to roughly esti-
mate what the maximum one-period loss was historically. (The pe-
riod may be one week, one day, or one hour. The only criterion to
use is that you should be ready to rebalance your portfolio accord-
ing to the Kelly formula at the end of every period.) You should also
have in mind what is the maximum one-period drawdown on your
equity that you are willing to suffer. Dividing the maximum tolera-
ble one-period drawdown on equity by the maximum historical loss
will tell you whether even half-Kelly leverage is too large for your
comfort. The leverage to use is always the smaller of the half-Kelly
leverage and the maximum leverage obtained using the worst histor-
ical loss. In the S&P 500 index example in the previous section, the


<!-- PAGE 128 -->

106
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
maximum historical one-day loss is about 20.47 percent, which oc-
curred on October 19, 1987—“Black Monday.” If you can tolerate
only a 20 percent one-day drawdown on equity, then the maxi-
mum leverage you can apply is about 1. Meanwhile, the leverage
recommended by half-Kelly is 1.26. Hence, in this case, even half-
Kelly leverage would not be conservative enough to survive Black
Monday.
The truly scary scenario in risk management is the one that
has not occurred in history before. Echoing the philosopher Lud-
wig Wittgenstein, “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be
silent”—on such unknowables, theoretical models are appropriately
silent.

Some traders believe that good risk management means imposing stop loss on
every trade; that is, if a position incurs a certain percent loss, the trader will
exit the position. It is a common fallacy to believe that imposing stop loss will
prevent the portfolio from suﬀering catastrophic losses. When a catastrophic
event occurs, securities prices will drop discontinuously, so the stop loss orders
to exit the positions will only be ﬁlled at prices much worse than those before
the event. So, by exiting the positions, we are actually realizing the catastrophic
loss and not avoiding it. For stop loss to be beneﬁcial, we must believe that we
are in a momentum, or trending, regime. In other words, we must believe that
the prices will get worse within the expected lifetime of our trade. Otherwise, if
the market is mean reverting within that lifetime, we will eventually recoup our
losses if we didn’t exit the position too quickly.
Of course, it is not easy to tell whether one is in a momentum regime (when
stop loss is beneﬁcial) or in a mean-reverting regime (when stop loss is harm-
ful). My own observation is that when the movement of prices is due to news
or other fundamental reasons (such as a company’s deteriorating revenue), one
is likely to be in a momentum regime, and one should not “stand in front of
a freight train,” in traders’ vernacular. For example, if a fundamental analysis
of a company reveals that it is currently overvalued, its stock price will likely
gradually decrease (at least in relation to the market index) in order to reach
a new, lower equilibrium price. This movement to the lower equilibrium price
is irreversible as long as the fundamental economics of the company does not
change. However, when securities prices move drastically without any apparent
news or reasons, it is likely that the move is the result of a liquidity event—for
example, major holders of the securities suddenly need to liquidate large


<!-- PAGE 129 -->

Money and Risk Management
107
positions for their own idiosyncratic reasons, or major speculators suddenly
decide to cover their short positions. These liquidity events are of relatively
short durations and mean reversion to the previous price levels is likely.
I will discuss in some more detail the appropriate exit strategies for mean-
reverting versus momentum strategies in Chapter 7.
Beyond position risk (which is comprised of both market risk
and speciﬁc risk), there are other forms of risks to consider: model
risk, software risk, and natural disaster risk, in decreasing order of
likelihood.
Model risk simply refers to the possibility that trading losses are
not due to the statistical vagaries of the market, but to the fact that
the trading model is wrong. It could be wrong for a large number of
reasons, some of which were detailed in Chapter 3: data-snooping
bias, survivorship bias, and so on. To eliminate all these different
biases and errors in the backtest programs, it is extremely helpful to
have a collaborator or consultant to duplicate your backtest results
independently to ensure their validity. This need to duplicate results
is routinely done in scientiﬁc research and is no less essential in
ﬁnancial research.
Model risk can also come not from any bias or error in your
model or backtesting procedure, but from increased competition
from other institutional traders all running the same strategy as
you; or it could be a result of some fundamental change in market
structure that eliminated the edge of your trading model. This is the
regime shift that I talked about in Chapter 5.
There is not much you can do to alleviate these sources of model
risk, except to gradually lower the leverage of the model as it racks
up losses, up to the point where the leverage is zero. This can be ac-
complished in a systematic way if you constantly update the lever-
age according to the Kelly formula based on the trailing mean return
and standard deviation. (As the mean return decreases to zero in the
lookback period, your Kelly leverage will be driven to zero.) This
is preferable to abruptly shutting down a model because of a large
drawdown (see my discussion of the psychological pressure to shut
down models prematurely in the following section on psychological
preparedness).


<!-- PAGE 130 -->

108
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Software risk refers to the case where the automated trading
system that generates trades every day actually does not faith-
fully reﬂect your backtest model. This happens because of the om-
nipresent software bugs. I discussed the way to eliminate such soft-
ware errors in Chapter 5: you should compare the trades generated
by your automated trading system with the theoretical trades gener-
ated by your backtest system to ensure that they are the same.
Finally, physical or natural disasters can happen, which can
cause big losses, and they don’t have to be anything dramatic like
earthquakes or tsunami. What if your Internet connection went
down before you could enter a hedging position? What if your power
went down in the middle of transmitting a trade? The different meth-
ods of preventing physical disasters from causing major disruptions
to your trading can be found in the section on physical infrastruc-
ture in Chapter 4.
PSYCHOLOGICAL PREPAREDNESS
It may seem strange that a book on quantitative trading would in-
clude a section on psychological preparedness. After all, isn’t quan-
titative trading supposed to liberate us from our emotions and let the
computer make all the trading decisions in a disciplined manner? If
only it were this easy: human traders who are not psychologically
prepared will often override their automated trading systems’ deci-
sions, especially when there is a position or day with abnormal proﬁt
or loss. Hence, it is critical even if we trade using quantitative strate-
gies to understand some of our own psychological weaknesses.
Fortunately, there is a ﬁeld of ﬁnancial research called “behav-
ioral ﬁnance” (Thaler, 1994) that studies irrational ﬁnancial decision
making. I will try to highlight a few of the common irrational behav-
iors that affect trading.
The ﬁrst behavioral bias is known variously as the endowment
effect, status quo bias, or loss aversion. The ﬁrst two effects cause
some traders to hold on to a losing position for too long, because
traders (and people in general) give too much preference to the sta-
tus quo (the status quo bias), or because they demand much more


<!-- PAGE 131 -->

Money and Risk Management
109
to give up the stock than what they would pay to acquire it (the en-
dowment effect). As I argued in the risk management section, there
are rational reasons to hold on to a losing position (e.g., when you
expect mean-reverting behavior); however, these behavioral biases
cause traders to hold on to losing positions even when there is no
rational reason (e.g., when you expect trending behavior, and the
trend is such that your positions will lose even more). At the same
time, the loss aversion bias causes some traders to exit their prof-
itable positions too soon, even if holding longer will lead to a larger
proﬁt on average. Why do they exit the proﬁtable positions so soon?
Because the pain from possibly losing some of the current proﬁts
outweighs the pleasure from gaining higher proﬁts.
This behavioral bias manifests itself most clearly and most dis-
astrously when one has entered a position by mistake (because of
either a software bug, an operational error, or a data problem) and
has incurred a big loss. The rational step to take is to exit the po-
sition immediately upon discovery of the error. However, traders
are often tempted to wait for mean reversion such that the loss is
smaller before they exit. Unless you have a model for mean rever-
sion that suggests now is a good time to enter into this position,
this wait for mean reversion may very well lead to bigger losses
instead.
Another common bias that I have personally experienced is the
“representativeness bias”—people tend to put too much weight on
recent experience and underweight long-term average (Ritter, 2003).
(This reference has a good introduction to various biases studied
by behavioral ﬁnance.) After a big loss, traders—even quantitative
traders—tend to immediately modify certain parameters of their
strategies so that they would have avoided the big loss if they were
to trade this modiﬁed system. But, of course, this is unwise because
this modiﬁcation may invite some other big loss that is yet to hap-
pen, or it may have eliminated many proﬁt opportunities that ex-
isted. We must remember that we are operating in a probabilistic
regime: No system can avoid all the market vagaries that can result
in losses.
If you feel that your system really is deﬁcient and want to tweak
it, you should always backtest the modiﬁed version to make sure


<!-- PAGE 132 -->

that it does outperform the old system over a sufﬁciently long back-
test period, not just over the last few weeks.
There are two major psychological weaknesses that are more
well known to the traders than to economists: despair and greed.
Despair occurs when a trading model is in a major, prolonged
drawdown. Many traders (and their managers, investors, etc.) will
be under great pressure under this circumstance to shut down the
model completely. Other overly self-conﬁdent traders with a reck-
less bent will do the opposite: They will double their bets on their
losing models, hoping to recoup their losses eventually, if and when
the models rebound. Neither behavior is rational: if you have been
managing your capital allocation and leverage by the Kelly for-
mula, you would lower the capital allocation for the losing model
gradually.
Greed is the more usual emotion when the model is having a
good run and is generating a lot of proﬁts. The temptation now is to
increase its leverage quickly in order to get rich quickly. Once again,
a well-disciplined quantitative trader will keep the leverage below
the dictates of the Kelly formula as well as the caution imposed by
the possibility of fat-tail events.
Both despair and greed can lead to overleveraging (i.e., trad-
ing an overly large portfolio): In despair, one tries to recoup the
losses by adding fresh capital; in greed, one adds capital too
quickly after initial successes with a strategy. Therefore, the one
golden rule in risk management is to keep the size of your port-
folio under control at all times. This is, however, easier said than
done. Large, well-known funds have succumbed to the tempta-
tion to overleverage and failed: Long-Term Capital Management in
2000 (Lowenstein, 2000) and Amaranth Advisors in 2006 (epchan.
blogspot.com/2006/10/highly-improbable-event.html). In the Ama-
ranth Advisors case, the leverage employed on one single strategy
(natural gas calendar spread trade) due to one single trader (Brian
Hunter) is so large that a $6 billion dollar loss was incurred, com-
fortably wiping out the fund’s equity—a textbook case of risk mis-
management.
I have experienced this pressure myself both in an institutional
setting and in a personal setting, and the unfortunate result both

times was to succumb prematurely. When I was with a money man-
agement ﬁrm, I lost over $1 million for the fund’s investors because,
in a ﬁt of greed, I added over $100 million to a portfolio based on a
strategy that had been traded for barely six months. (That was be-
fore I learned of the Kelly criterion.) As if this is not enough lesson,
I repeated the same mistake again when I started trading indepen-
dently. It concerns a mean-reverting spread strategy involving XLE,
an energy exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the crude oil future (CL).
When the spread refused to mean revert over time, I stubbornly in-
creased the size of the spread to almost $500,000. Finally, despair
set in, and I exited the spread with close to a six-ﬁgure loss. Natu-
rally, the spread started to revert afterward when I wasn’t around to
beneﬁt. (Fortunately, several of my other strategies performed well
in that ﬁrst year of my independent trading, so the ﬁscal year ended
with only a small overall loss.)
How should we train ourselves to overcome these psychologi-
cal weaknesses and learn not to override the models manually and
to remedy trading errors correctly and expeditiously? As with most
human endeavors, the way to do this is to start with a small port-
folio and gradually gain psychological preparedness, discipline, and
conﬁdence in your models. As you become emotionally more able
to handle the daily swings in proﬁt and loss (P&L) and rein in the
primordial urges of the psyche, your portfolio’s actual performance
will hew to the theoretically expected performance of your strategy.
I have certainly found that to be the case after getting over those
aforementioned disastrous trades. My newfound discipline and faith
in the Kelly formula has so far prevented similar disasters from hap-
pening again.
SUMMARY
Risk management is a crucial discipline in trading. The trading world
is littered with numerous examples of giant hedge funds and invest-
ment banks laid low by enormous losses due to a single trade or in a
very short period of time. Most of these losses are due to overlever-
aging positions and not to an inherently erroneous model. Typically,


<!-- PAGE 134 -->

112
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
traders will not overleverage a model that has not worked very well.
It is a hitherto superbly performing model that is at the greatest risk
of huge loss due to overconﬁdence and overleverage. This chapter
therefore provides an important tool for risk management: the de-
termination of the optimal leverage using the Kelly formula.
Besides the determination of the optimal leverage, the Kelly for-
mula has a very useful side beneﬁt: It also determines the optimal
allocation of capital among different strategies, based on the covari-
ance of their returns.
But no risk management formula or system will prevent disas-
ters if you are not psychologically prepared for the ups and downs
of trading and thus deviating from the prescriptions of rational de-
cision making (i.e., your models). The ultimate risk management
mind-set is very simple: Do not succumb to either despair or greed.
To gain practice in this psychological discipline, one must proceed
slowly with small position size, and thoroughly test various aspects
of the trading business (model, software, operational procedure,
money and risk management) before scaling up according to the
Kelly formula.
I have found that in order to proceed slowly and cautiously, it
is helpful to have other sources of income or other businesses to
help sustain yourself either ﬁnancially or emotionally (to avoid the
boredom associated with slow progress). It is indeed possible that
ﬁnding a diversion, whether income producing or not, may actually
help improve the long-term growth of your wealth.
APPENDIX: A SIMPLE DERIVATION OF
THE KELLY FORMULA WHEN RETURN
DISTRIBUTION IS GAUSSIAN
If we assume that the return distribution of a strategy (or security) is
Gaussian, then the Kelly formula can be derived very easily. We start
with the formula for a compounded, levered growth rate applicable
to a Gaussian process:
g( f ) = r + f m−s2 f 2/2


<!-- PAGE 135 -->

Money and Risk Management
113
where f is the leverage, r is the risk-free rate; m is the average sim-
ple, uncompounded one-period excess return; and s is the standard
deviation of those uncompounded returns. This formula for com-
pounded growth rate can itself be derived quite simply, but not as
simply as the Kelly formula, so I leave its derivation for the reader
to look up in the Thorp article referenced earlier.
To ﬁnd the optimal f which maximizes g, simply take its ﬁrst
derivative with respect to f and set the derivative to zero:
dg/df = m−s2 f = 0
Solving this equation for f gives us f=m/s2, the Kelly formula for
one strategy or security under the Gaussian assumption.

he ﬁrst six chapters of this book covered most of the ba-
sic knowledge needed to research, develop, and execute your
own quantitative strategy. This chapter explains important
themes in quantitative trading in more detail. These themes form the
bases of statistical arbitrage trading, and most quantitative traders
are conversant in some if not most of these topics. They are also
very helpful in informing our intuition about trading.
I will describe the two basic categories of trading strategies:
mean-reverting versus momentum strategies. Periods of mean-
reverting and trending behaviors are examples of what some traders
call regimes, and the switch between different regimes is a topic of
discussion here. Mean-reverting strategies derive their mathemati-
cal justiﬁcation from the concepts of stationarity and cointegration
of time series, which I will cover next. Then I will describe a the-
ory that many hedge funds use to manage large portfolios and one
that has caused much turmoil in their performances: namely, factor
models. Other categories of strategies that traders frequently dis-
cuss are seasonal trading and high-frequency strategies. All trading
strategies require a way to exit their positions; I will describe the dif-
ferent logical ways to do this. Finally, I ponder the question of how
to best enhance the returns of a strategy: through higher leverage or
trading higher-beta stocks?

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
MEAN-REVERTING VERSUS
MOMENTUM STRATEGIES
Trading strategies can be proﬁtable only if securities prices are
either mean-reverting or trending. Otherwise, they are random-
walking, and trading will be futile. If you believe that prices are mean
reverting and that they are currently low relative to some reference
price, you should buy now and plan to sell higher later. However, if
you believe the prices are trending and that they are currently low,
you should (short) sell now and plan to buy at an even lower price
later. The opposite is true if you believe prices are high.
Academic research has indicated that stock prices are on av-
erage very close to random walking. However, this does not mean
that under certain special conditions, they cannot exhibit some de-
gree of mean reversion or trending behavior. Furthermore, at any
given time, stock prices can be both mean reverting and trending
depending on the time horizon you are interested in. Constructing a
trading strategy is essentially a matter of determining if the prices
under certain conditions and for a certain time horizon will be mean
reverting or trending, and what the initial reference price should be
at any given time. (When the prices are trending, they are also said
to have “momentum,” and thus the corresponding trading strategy
is often called a momentum strategy.)
Some people like to describe the phenomenon that prices can
be both mean reverting and trending at the same time as the “frac-
tal” nature of stock prices. Technical analysts or chartists like to
use the so-called Elliott wave theory to analyze such phenomena.
Still others like to use the discipline of machine learning or artiﬁ-
cial intelligence (in particular, techniques such as hidden Markov
models, Kalman ﬁlter, neural networks, etc.) to discover whether
the prices are in a mean-reverting or trending “regime.” I person-
ally have not found such general theories of mean reversion or mo-
mentum particularly useful. (See, however, the section on regime
switching, which describes an apparently successful attempt to pre-
dict regime switch for one particular stock.) Rather, I ﬁnd it is usu-
ally safe to assume that, unless the expected earnings of a company


<!-- PAGE 139 -->

Special Topics in Quantitative Trading
117
have changed, stock prices will be mean reverting. In fact, ﬁnancial
researchers (Khandani and Lo, 2007) have constructed a very simple
short-term mean reversal model that is proﬁtable (before transac-
tion costs) over many years. Of course, whether the mean reversion
is strong enough and consistent enough such that we can trade prof-
itably after factoring in transaction costs is another matter, and it is
up to you, the trader, to ﬁnd those special circumstances when it is
strong and consistent.
Though mean reversion is quite prevalent, backtesting a prof-
itable mean-reverting strategy can be quite perilous.
Many historical ﬁnancial databases contain errors in price
quotes. Any such error tends to artiﬁcially inﬂate the performance
of mean-reverting strategies. It is easy to see why: a mean-reverting
strategy will buy on a ﬁctitious quote that is much lower than some
moving average and sell on the next correct quote that is in line with
the moving average and thus makes a proﬁt. One must make sure the
data is thoroughly cleansed of such ﬁctitious quotes before one can
completely trust your backtesting performance on a mean-reverting
strategy.
Survivorship bias also affects the backtesting of mean-reverting
strategies disproportionately, as I discussed in Chapter 3. Stocks
that went through extreme price actions are likely to be either ac-
quired (the prices went very high) or went bankrupt (the prices
went to zeros). A mean-reverting strategy will short the former and
buy the latter, losing money in both cases. However, these stocks
may not appear at all in your historical database if it has survivor-
ship bias, thus artiﬁcially inﬂating your backtest performance. You
can look up Table 3.1 to ﬁnd out which database has survivor-
ship bias.

of
information—as more people become aware of certain news, more
people decide to buy or sell a stock, thereby driving the price in
the same direction. I suggested earlier that stock prices may ex-
hibit momentum when the expected earnings have changed. This
can happen when a company announces its quarterly earnings, and
investors either gradually become aware of this announcement or


<!-- PAGE 140 -->

118
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
they react to this change by incrementally executing a large or-
der (so as to minimize market impact). And indeed, this leads to
a momentum strategy called post earnings announcement drift, or
PEAD. (For a particularly useful article with lots of references on
this strategy, look up quantlogic.blogspot.com/2006/03/pocket-phd-
post-earning-announcment.html.) Essentially, this strategy recom-
mends that you buy a stock when its earnings exceed expectations,
and short a stock when it falls short. More generally, many news an-
nouncements have the potential of altering expectations of a stock’s
future earnings, and therefore have the potential to trigger a trend-
ing period. As to what kind of news will trigger this, and how long
the trending period will last, it is again up to you to ﬁnd out.
Besides the slow diffusion of information, momentum can be
caused by the incremental execution of a large order due to the li-
quidity needs or private investment decisions of a large investor.
This cause probably accounts for more instances of short-term mo-
mentum than any other causes. With the advent of increasingly so-
phisticated execution algorithms adopted by the large brokerages, it
is, however, increasingly difﬁcult to ascertain whether a large order
is behind the observed momentum.
Momentum can also be generated by the herdlike behavior of in-
vestors: investors interpret the (possibly random and meaningless)
buying or selling decisions of others as the sole justiﬁcations of their
own trading decisions. As Yale economist Robert Schiller said in the
New York Times (Schiller, 2008), nobody has all the information
they need in order to make a fully informed ﬁnancial decision. One
has to rely on the judgment of others. There is, however, no sure
way to discern the quality of the judgment of others. More problem-
atically, people make their ﬁnancial decisions at different times, not
meeting at a town hall and reaching a consensus once and for all.
The ﬁrst person who paid a high price for a house is “informing”
the others that houses are good investments, which leads another
person to make the same decision, and so on. Thus, a possibly erro-
neous decision by the ﬁrst buyer is propagated as “information” to a
herd of others.
Unfortunately, momentum regimes generated by these two
causes (private liquidity needs and herdlike behavior) have highly


<!-- PAGE 141 -->

unpredictable time horizons. How could you know how big an or-
der an institution needs to execute incrementally? How do you pre-
dict when the “herd” is large enough to form a stampede? Where is
the infamous tipping point? If we do not have a reliable way to es-
timate these time horizons, we cannot execute a momentum trade
proﬁtably based on these phenomena. In a later section on regime
switch, I will examine some attempts to predict these tipping or
“turning” points.
There is one last contrast between mean-reverting and mo-
mentum strategies that is worth pondering. What are the effects
of increasing competition from traders with the same strategies?
For mean-reverting strategies, the effect typically is the gradual
elimination of any arbitrage opportunity, and thus gradually dimin-
ishing returns down to zero. When the number of arbitrage op-
portunities has been reduced to almost zero, the mean-reverting
strategy is subject to the risk that an increasing percentage of
trading signals are actually due to fundamental changes in stocks’
valuation and thus is not going to mean revert. For momentum
strategies, the effect of competition is often the diminishing of the
time horizon over which the trend will continue. As news dissem-
inates at a faster rate and as more traders take advantage of this
trend earlier on, the equilibrium price will be reached sooner. Any
trade entered after this equilibrium price is reached will be unprof-
itable.
REGIME SWITCHING*
The concept of regimes is most basic to ﬁnancial markets. What
else are “bull” and “bear” markets if not regimes? The desire to pre-
dict regime switches, which are also commonly known as turning
points, is also as old as ﬁnancial markets themselves.
If our attempts to predict the switching from a bull to a
bear market were even slightly successful, we could focus our

magazine.

discussion to this one type of switching and call it a day. If only
it were that easy. The difﬁculty with predicting this type of switch-
ing encourages researchers to look more broadly at other types of
regime switching in the ﬁnancial markets, hoping to ﬁnd some that
may be more amenable to existing statistical tools.
I have already described two regime switches (or “shifts,” for
these two examples did not switch back to their former regimes)
that are due to changes in market and regulatory structures: deci-
malization of stock prices in 2003 and the elimination of the short-
sale plus-tick rule in 2007. (See Chapter 5 for details.) These regime
shifts are preannounced by the government, so no predictions of
the shifts are necessary, though few people can predict the exact
consequences of the regulatory changes.
Some of the other most common ﬁnancial or economic regimes
studied are inﬂationary vs. recessionary regimes, high- vs. low-
volatility regimes, and mean-reverting vs. trending regimes. Among
these, volatility regime switching seems to be most amenable to
classical econometric tools such as the generalized autoregres-
sive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model (See Klaassen,
2002). That is not surprising, as there is a long history of success
among ﬁnancial economists in modeling volatilities as opposed to
the underlying stock prices themselves. While such predictions of
volatility regime switches can be of great value to options traders,
they are unfortunately of no help to stock traders.
Academic attempts to model regime switches in stock prices
generally proceed along these lines:
1. Propose that the two (or more) regimes are characterized by
different probability distributions of the prices. In the simplest
cases, the log of the prices of both regimes may be represented
by normal distributions, except that they have different means
and/or standard deviations.
2. Assume that there is some kind of transition probability among
the regimes.
3. Determine the exact parameters that specify the regime proba-
bility distributions and the transition probabilities by ﬁtting the

121
model to past prices, using standard statistical methods such as
maximum likelihood estimation.
4. Based on the ﬁtted model above, ﬁnd out the expected regime
of the next time step and, more importantly, the expected stock
price.
This type of approach is usually called Markov regime switch-
ing or hidden Markov models, and it is generally based on a
Bayesian probabilistic framework. Readers who are interested in
reading more about some of these approaches may peruse Nielsen
and Olesen (2000), van Norden and Schaller (1993), or Kaufmann
and Scheicher (1996).
Despite the elegant theoretical framework, such Markov regime-
switching models are generally useless for actual trading purposes.
The reason for this weakness is that they assume constant tran-
sition probabilities among regimes at all times. In practice, this
means that at any time (as illustrated by the Nielsen and Olesen pa-
per), there is always a very small probability for the stock to tran-
sition from a normal, quiescent regime to a volatile regime. But this
is useless to traders who want to know when—and under what pre-
cise conditions—the transition probability will suddenly peak. This
question is tackled by the turning points models.
Turning points models take a data mining approach (Chai, 2007):
Enter all possible variables that might predict a turning point or
regime switch. Variables such as current volatility; last-period re-
turn; or changes in macroeconomic numbers such as consumer con-
ﬁdence, oil price changes, bond price changes, and so on can all
be part of this input. In fact, in a very topical article about turning
points in the real estate market by economist Robert Schiller (2007),
it was suggested that the crescendo of media chatter about impend-
ing boom or bust may actually be a good predictor of a coming turn-
ing point.
In Example 7.1, I illustrate how we might detect turning points
using a data-mining approach with just simple technical indicators
built on stock price series as inputs while using stock returns of
multiple holding periods as outputs.

Example 7.1: Using a Machine Learning Tool to Proﬁt from
Regime Switching in the Stock Market
As I discussed in the main text, I believe that regime switching can be most
easily discovered by using a data-mining approach: examining a massive
number of indicators to see which one might predict a switch. This is nor-
mally a very onerous task, even with MATLAB. But, luckily, a recent machine
learning program has enabled this discovery process to be done in a matter
of hours.
I shall employ a tool here called Alphacet Discovery, which is an inte-
grated backtesting and execution platform recently launched by Alphacet,
Inc. (www.alphacet.com. Full disclosure: Alphacet is a client of my ﬁrm.)
This platform not only integrates all historical and real-time data needed
for rapid strategy prototyping, backtesting, analysis, and real-time deploy-
ment; it also contains an expanding array of machine learning programs
such as neural networks and genetic algorithms that are well suited to data
mining for the kind of relationships we are seeking.
I will pick a prominent brokerage stock—GS—as a proxy for the ﬁnan-
cial sector. My objective is to ﬁnd out if I can detect turning points in this
sector where it goes from bull to bear and back. My initial hypothesis is that
major shifts of interest rates, a release of government macroeconomic data,
or earnings announcements are likely triggers of turning points. At the time
of this writing, Alphacet had not yet completed integration of macroeco-
nomic or company news data into its database, so I will use a large percent
change in GS as proxy for such news releases. Furthermore, I believe that
whenever GS reaches an N-day high or low just before this large drop or
rise in prices occurs is a good signal that a previous regime is close to an
end. So I shall use this condition as an additional input as well.
The search problem we face is: How large a percent change is suﬃcient
to trigger a regime switch? What should N be in the N-day high/low con-
dition? And how long does the new regime generally last? (In other words,
what is the optimal holding period?) To answer these questions in the old-
fashioned, manual way is very time consuming, as one has to run multi-
ple simulations with diﬀerent thresholds for the independent variables and
multiple return horizons for the dependent variables. Let’s see if Alphacet
Discovery can help us automate this process.
The independent variables of the model are just the one-day returns
of GS. The dependent variables are the future returns of GS within various
holding periods. Discovery can easily ﬁnd an optimal rule, or an optimal
combination of rules, which will lead to the best backtest performance. In
our case, each percent-change threshold can be encapsulated as a rule. I
entered two thresholds for buys and two for shorts: −1 percent, −3 percent,


<!-- PAGE 145 -->

123
1 percent, and 3 percent. Similarly, each holding period can be encapsulated
as a rule, too, and I entered six such periods: 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 days.
To prepare the price, percent-change, and 10-day high/low time series
for this search is very easy: most things can be done by drag and drop,
using a mouse, in Discovery. (For simplicity, I ﬁx N to 10 for the strategy
here, but this parameter can be optimized as well.) I just dragged a GS
price series into the strategy editor and speciﬁed a 1-day frequency with
the available controls. (The price series started around December 2006.)
See box S1 in Figure 7.1. Then I dragged several prepackaged “Rules” that
compute the 1-day percent change, and simple 10-day moving highs and
lows of a series to the strategy editor (box I2 in Figure 7.1.). And I feed
the original price series into the Program Group box by directing an arrow
from the Symbol Group box to the Program Group box.
FIGURE 7.1

Now I can create the entry rules by using the drop-down menus and
typing into the textboxes inside a new Rule box’s editor. Figure 7.2 shows
what’s inside Rule box R3 for the buy-and-sell rule based on a change of
±1 percent. I have created a similar Rule box for ±3 percent. Note that,
by default, subsequent entry signals will override positions established by
previous signals.

Inside a Rule Box
We can specify the holding periods using the prepackaged program
called “Holding Period” with diﬀerent parameters. (In fact, you can easily
create such programs yourself if you know the programming language Lisp.)
These are all encapsulated in the box I5 (and I6 for the ±2 percent rule
separately). We feed the output of the boxes R3 to I5 by drawing an arrow,
and similarly R4 to I9.
Finally, we run a perceptron learning algorithm on the outputs of I7 and
I9 (a perceptron is a type of neural network). This algorithm will ﬁnd out the
best weights for the diﬀerent rules with diﬀerent holding periods (among
other parameters) based on a moving window of historical training data
with the objective of maximizing the total proﬁt in this window. Based on
these optimized weights, the perceptron will trigger a buy-and-sell decision
at the end of each period. (Examples of other algorithms that you can select
are genetic algorithm and a K-nearest-neighbor clustering technique.)
Interestingly, the perceptron will not force us to hold a position for
exactly N days, even though that was what the component rule was con-
structed to do so in the moving window. Every day, the strategy will decide
whether to buy, sell, or do nothing, based on the latest parameter optimiza-
tion using the latest data in the moving window and the resulting linearly
weighted decisions from the diﬀerent rules.

Now we are ready to look at the performance results of this strategy.
We can bring up Discovery’s charting application for this. In Figure 7.3, I
have shown three of the best equity curves that come from the perceptron
optimization. The best curve belongs to a model using a 50-day moving
window for the optimization. (The length of the moving window can itself
be an object of optimization, but we will skip that step here.) On the side-
bar of the charting application, we can see that this strategy has a 37.93
percent gross cumulative return over a six-month backtest period, with 89
round-trip trades. (This is to be compared with a 15.77 percent return of a
buy-and-hold strategy on GS, with a 14 percent drawdown.) We have also
shown the best equity curve from the various holding period routines to
quantify the improvement from optimization (holding period of 10 days in
I5 on the 1 percent rule at R3), which has a gross cumulative return of 18.55
percent over the period.
Though the backtest period is short, this return looks very impressive.
Can something be wrong? In particular, what about the much-feared data-
snooping bias that seems to creep into every strategy that is based on ma-
chine learning or artiﬁcial intelligence? The basic philosophy of Alphacet
FIGURE 7.3

Discovery is to prevent this kind of bias from happening. In theory, though
not in our particular illustration here, optimization over all rules and all
parameters can be done in a backward-looking moving window, so that we
are using absolutely no unseen future data for the backtest. Of course, data-
snooping bias can still creep in because we can abandon a whole category
of models when the performance is poor and try one new category after
another until it improves. But then, this is unavoidable whenever we are in
the business of backtesting.
One should also note that the parameters that the search engine is
allowed to optimize over in this case are actually quite limited: They are
just the diﬀerent holding periods. This further reduces the danger of data-
snooping bias.
Since the backtest looks good, I can immediately press a single button
and have this strategy run against real-time data and generate orders in
either a paper or a real trading account.
As you can see, it may not be hard to create a regime-switching model
with the simplest of technical indicators as long as one is able to eﬃ-
ciently optimize over a large number of parameters, conducted strictly
in a backward-looking moving window. (See my sidebar on “Parameter-
less Trading Models” in Chapter 3.) The performance may even be bet-
ter if we can conﬁrm the price moves with macroeconomic or company-
speciﬁc news. I believe that this same technique can be applied proﬁtably
to many exchange-traded funds (ETFs), futures, or even currency trading
as well.
I would like to thank Rosario Ingargiola, chief technology oﬃcer of Alphacet, Inc., for
his help in using Alphacet Discovery to develop the strategy shown here.
STATIONARITY AND COINTEGRATION
A time series is “stationary” if it never drifts farther and farther away
from its initial value. In technical terms, stationary time series are
“integrated of order zero,” or I(0). (See Alexander, 2001.) It is obvi-
ous that if the price series of a security is stationary, it would be a
great candidate for a mean-reversion strategy. Unfortunately, most
stock price series are not stationary—they exhibit a geometric ran-
dom walk that gets them farther and farther away from their start-
ing (i.e., initial public offering) values. However, you can often ﬁnd

a pair of stocks such that if you long one and short the other, the
market value of the pair is stationary. If this is the case, then the
two individual time series are said to be cointegrated. They are so
described because a linear combination of them is integrated of or-
der zero. Typically, two stocks that form a cointegrating pair are
from the same industry group. Traders have long been familiar with
this so-called pair-trading strategy. They buy the pair portfolio when
the spread of the stock prices formed by these pairs is low, and
sell/short the pair when the spread is high—in other words, a classic
mean-reverting strategy.
An example of a pair of cointegrating price series is the gold
ETF GLD versus the gold miners ETF, GDX, which I discussed
in Example 3.6. If we form a portfolio with long 1 share of GLD
and short 1.6766 share of GDX, the prices of the portfolio form a
stationary time series (see Figure 7.4). The exact number of shares
of GLD and GDX can be determined by a regression ﬁt of the two
component time series (see Example 7.2).

Example 7.2: How to Form a Good Cointegrating
(and Mean-Reverting) Pair of Stocks
As I explained in the main text, if you long one security and short
another one in the same industry group and in the right proportion,
sometimes the combination (or “spread”) becomes a stationary series.
A stationary series is an excellent candidate for a mean-reverting strat-
egy. This example teaches you how to use a free MATLAB package
downloadable at www.spatial-econometrics.com to determine if two price
series are cointegrated and, if so, how to ﬁnd the optimal “hedge ratio” (i.e.,
the number of shares of the second security versus one share of the ﬁrst
security).
The main method used to test for cointegration is called the cointegrat-
ing augmented Dickey-Fuller test, hence the function name cadf. A detailed
description of this method can be found in the manual also available on the
same web site mentioned earlier.

If a price series (of a stock, a pair of stocks, or, in general, a port-
folio of stocks) is stationary, then a mean-reverting strategy is guar-
anteed to be proﬁtable, as long as the stationarity persists into the
future (which is by no means guaranteed). However, the converse is
not true. You don’t necessarily need a stationary price series in order
to have a successful mean-reverting strategy. Even a nonstationary
price series can have many short-term reversal opportunities that
one can exploit, as many traders have discovered.
Many pair traders are unfamiliar with the concepts of station-
arity and cointegration. But most of them are familiar with correla-
tion, which superﬁcially seems to mean the same thing as cointe-
gration. Actually, they are quite different. Correlation between two
price series actually refers to the correlations of their returns over
some time horizon (for concreteness, let’s say a day). If two stocks
are positively correlated, there is a good chance that their prices
will move in the same direction most days. However, having a posi-
tive correlation does not say anything about the long-term behavior
of the two stocks. In particular, it doesn’t guarantee that the stock
prices will not grow farther and farther apart in the long run even
if they do move in the same direction most days. However, if two
stocks were cointegrated and remain so in the future, their prices
(weighted appropriately) will be unlikely to diverge. Yet their daily
(or weekly, or any other time horizon) returns may be quite uncor-
related.
As an artiﬁcial example of two stocks, A and B, that are coin-
tegrated but not correlated, see Figure 7.6. Stock B clearly doesn’t
move in any correlated fashion with stock A: Some days they move
in the same direction, other days the opposite. Most days, stock B
doesn’t move at all. But notice that the spread in stock prices be-
tween A and B always returns to about $1 after a while.
Can we ﬁnd real-life example of this phenomenon? Well, KO
versus PEP is one. In the program example7 3.m I have shown
that they do not cointegrate. If, however, you test their daily re-
turns for correlation, you will ﬁnd that their correlation of 0.4849
is indeed statistically signiﬁcant. The correlation test is presented
at the end of the example7 3.m program and shown here in
Example 7.3.

The cointegration test for KO and PEP is the same as that for GDX and

epchan.com/book/example7 3.m) The cointegration result shows that the
t-statistic for the augmented Dicky-Fuller test is −2.14, larger than the 10
percent critical value of −3.038, meaning that there is a less than 90 percent
probability that these two time series are cointegrated.

Stationarity is not limited to the spread between stocks: it can
also be found in certain currency rates. For example, the Cana-
dian dollar/Australian dollar (CAD/AUD) cross-currency rate is quite
stationary, both being commodities currencies. Numerous pairs of
futures as well as well as ﬁxed-income instruments can be found
to be cointegrating as well. (The simplest examples of cointegrat-
ing futures pairs are calendar spreads: long and short futures con-
tracts of the same underlying commodity but different expiration
months. Similarly for ﬁxed-income instruments, one can long and
short bonds by the same issuer but of different maturities.)
FACTOR MODELS
Financial commentators often say something like this: “The current
market favors value stocks,” “The market is focusing on earnings
growth,” or “Investors are paying attention to inﬂation numbers.”
How do we quantify these and other common drivers of returns?
There is a well-known framework in quantitative ﬁnance called
factor models (also known as arbitrage pricing theory [APT]) that
attempts to capture the different drivers of returns such as earnings
growth rates, interest rate, or the market capitalization of a com-
pany. These drivers are called factors. Mathematically, we can write
the excess returns (returns minus risk-free rate) R of N stocks as
R = Xb + u


<!-- PAGE 156 -->

134
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
where X is an N × N matrix of factor exposures (also known as
factor loadings), b is an N vector of factor returns, and u an N vector
of speciﬁc returns. (Every one of these quantities is time dependent,
but I suppress this explicit dependence for simplicity.)
The terms factor exposure, factor return, and speciﬁc return
are commonly used in quantitative ﬁnance, and it is well worth our
effort to understand their meanings. Factor returns are the com-
mon drivers of stock returns, and are therefore independent of a
particular stock. Factor exposures are the sensitivities to each of
these common drivers. Any part of a stock’s return that cannot be
explained by these common factor returns is deemed a speciﬁc re-
turn (i.e., speciﬁc to a stock and essentially regarded as just random
noise within the APT framework). Each stock’s speciﬁc return is as-
sumed to be uncorrelated to another stock’s.
Let’s illustrate these using a simple factor model called the
Fama-French Three-Factor model (Fama and French, 1992). This
model postulates that the excess return of a stock depends linearly
on only three factor exposures: its beta (i.e., its sensitivity to the
market index), its market capitalization, and its book-to-price ratio.
These factor exposures are obviously different for each stock and
for each time period. (Factor exposures are often normalized such
that the average of the factor exposures within a universe of stocks
is zero, and the standard deviation is 1.)
Now that we know how to calculate the factor exposures, what
about the factor returns and speciﬁc returns? We cannot directly
compute the factor returns and speciﬁc returns—we have to infer
their values by running a multivariate linear regression of the excess
returns of stocks against the factor exposures. Note that each stock
represents one data point in this linear regression, and we have to
either run a separate linear regression for each time period or, if
we want an average value over many time periods, aggregate the
values from all these time periods into one training set and run one
regression against them all.
If you perform this linear regression ﬁt over many time peri-
ods for the Fama-French Three-Factor model, you will ﬁnd that
the market capitalization factor return is usually negative (meaning


<!-- PAGE 157 -->

Special Topics in Quantitative Trading
135
that small-cap stocks usually outperform large-cap stocks), and the
book-to-price ratio factor return is usually positive (meaning value
stocks usually outperform growth stocks). And since most stocks
are positively correlated with the market index, the beta factor re-
turn is positive as well.
The Fama-French model has no monopoly on the choice of
factors. In fact, you can construct as many factors as creativity
and rationality allow. For example, you can choose return on eq-
uity as a factor exposure, or the correlation of the stock return
with the prime rate as another. You can choose any number of
other economic, fundamental, or technical factors. Whether the
factor exposures you have chosen are sensible or not will deter-
mine whether the factor model explains the excess returns of the
stocks adequately. If the factor exposures (and consequently the
model as a whole) are poorly chosen, the linear regression ﬁt will
produce speciﬁc returns of signiﬁcant sizes, and the R2 statistic
of the ﬁt will be small. According to experts (Grinold and Kahn,
1999), the R2 statistic of a good factor model with monthly re-
turns of 1,000 stocks and 50 factors is typically about 30 percent to
40 percent.
It may appear that these factor models are only explanatory in
retrospect—that is, given historical returns and factor exposures,
we can compute the factor returns of those historical periods. But
what good are those historical factor returns for our trading? It turns
out that often factor returns are more stable than individual stock
returns. In other words, they have momentum. You can therefore
assume that their values remain unchanged from the current period
(known from the regression ﬁt) to the next time period. If this is
the case, then, of course, you can also predict the excess returns,
as long as the factor exposures are well chosen and therefore the
time-varying speciﬁc returns are not signiﬁcant.
Let me clarify one point of potential confusion. Even though
I stated that factor models can be useful as a predictive model
(and therefore for trading) only if we assume the factor returns
have momentum, it does not mean that factor models cannot cap-
ture mean reversion of stock returns. You can, in fact, construct a


<!-- PAGE 158 -->

factor exposure that captures mean reversion, such as the negative
of the previous period return. If stock returns are indeed mean re-
verting, then the corresponding factor return will be positive.
If you are interested in building a trading model based on funda-
mental factors, there are a number of vendors from whom you can
obtain historical factor data:

Example 7.4: Principal Component Analysis as an Example of
Factor Model
The examples of factor exposures I described above are typically economic
(e.g., interest rates), fundamental (e.g., book-to-price ratio), or technical
(e.g., previous period’s return). To obtain historical values of these factor
exposures for a large portfolio of stocks so as to backtest a factor model
is usually quite expensive and not very practical to an independent trader.
(For those who are ﬁscally prepared to purchase such data, see the list in
the main text.) However, there is one kind of factor model that relies on
nothing more than historical returns to construct. This method is the so-
called principal component analysis (PCA).
If we use PCA to construct the factor exposures and factor returns, we
must assume that the factor exposures are constant (time independent)
over the estimation period. (This rules out factors that represent mean re-
version or momentum, since these factor exposures depend on the prior
period returns.) More importantly, we assume that the factor returns are
uncorrelated; that is to say, their covariance matrix ⟨bbT⟩is diagonal. If we
use the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix ⟨RRT⟩as the columns of the
matrix X in the APT equation R = X b + u above, we will ﬁnd via elementary
linear algebra that ⟨bbT⟩is indeed diagonal; and furthermore, the eigenval-
ues of ⟨RRT⟩are none other than the variances of the factor returns b. But
of course, there is no point to use factor analysis if the number of factors
is the same as the number of stocks—typically, we can just pick the eigen-
vectors with the top few eigenvalues to form the matrix X. The number of
eigenvectors to pick is a parameter that you can adjust to optimize your
trading model.

In the following MATLAB program (epchan.com/book/example7 4.m),
I illustrate a possible trading strategy applying PCA to S&P 600 small-cap
stocks. It is a strategy based on the assumption that factor returns have
momentum: They remain constant from the current time period to the next.
Hence, we can buy the stocks with the highest expected returns based on
these factors, and short the ones with the lowest expected returns. You will
ﬁnd that the average return of this strategy is negative, indicating that this
assumption may be quite inaccurate, or that speciﬁc returns are too large
for this strategy to work.

How good are the performances of factor models in real trad-
ing? Naturally, it mostly depends on which factor model we are
looking at. But one can make a general observation that factor mod-
els that are dominated by fundamental and macroeconomic factors
have one major drawback—they depend on the fact that investors
persist in using the same metric to value companies. This is just an-
other way of saying that the factor returns must have momentum for
factor models to work.
For example, even though the value (book-to-price ratio) factor
returns are usually positive, there are periods of time when investors
prefer growth stocks such as during the Internet bubble in the late
1990s, and in August and December of 2007. As The Economist
noted, one reason growth stocks were back in favor in 2007 is the
simple fact that their price premium over value stocks has narrowed
signiﬁcantly (Economist, 2007b). Another reason is that as the U.S.
economy slowed, investors increasingly opted for companies that
still managed to generate increasing earnings instead of those that
were hurt by the recessionary economy.
Therefore, it is not uncommon for factor models to experi-
ence steep drawdown during the times when investors’ valuation
method shifts, even if only for a short duration. But then, this prob-
lem is common to practically any trading model that holds stocks
overnight.

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
WHAT IS YOUR EXIT STRATEGY?
While entry signals are very speciﬁc to each trading strategy, there
isn’t usually much variety in the way exit signals are generated. They
are based on one of these:
r A ﬁxed holding period
r A target price or proﬁt cap
r The latest entry signals
r A stop price
A ﬁxed holding period is the default exit strategy for any trad-
ing strategy, whether it is a momentum model, a reversal model, or
some kind of seasonal trading strategy, which can be either momen-
tum or reversal based. (More on this later.) I said before that one of
the ways momentum is generated is the slow diffusion of informa-
tion. In this case, the process has a ﬁnite lifetime. The average value
of this ﬁnite lifetime determines the optimal holding period, which
can usually be discovered in a backtest.
One word of caution on determining the optimal holding period
of a momentum model: As I said before, this optimal period typically
decreases due to the increasing speed of the diffusion of information
and the increasing number of traders who catch on to this trading
opportunity. Hence, a momentum model that has worked well with a
holding period equal to a week in the backtest period may work only
with a one-day holding period now. Worse, the whole strategy may
become unproﬁtable a year into the future. Also, using a backtest of
the trading strategy to determine holding period can be fraught with
data-snooping bias, since the number of historical trades may be
limited. Unfortunately, for a momentum strategy where the trades
are triggered by news or events, there are no other alternatives. For
a mean-reverting strategy, however, there is a more statistically ro-
bust way to determine the optimal holding period that does not de-
pend on the limited number of actual trades.
The mean reversion of a time series can be modeled by an
equation called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck formula (Unlenbeck, 1930).
Let’s say we denote the mean-reverting spread (long market value


<!-- PAGE 163 -->

Special Topics in Quantitative Trading
141
minus short market value) of a pair of stocks as z(t). Then we can
write
dz(t) = −θ(z(t) −µ)dt + dW
where µ is the mean value of the prices over time, and dW is sim-
ply some random Gaussian noise. Given a time series of the daily
spread values, we can easily ﬁnd θ (and µ) by performing a linear
regression ﬁt of the daily change in the spread dz against the spread
itself. Mathematicians tell us that the average value of z(t) follows
an exponential decay to its mean µ, and the half-life of this expo-
nential decay is equal to ln(2)/θ, which is the expected time it takes
for the spread to revert to half its initial deviation from the mean.
This half-life can be used to determine the optimal holding period
for a mean-reverting position. Since we can make use of the entire
time series to ﬁnd the best estimate of θ, and not just on the days
where a trade was triggered, the estimate for the half-life is much
more robust than can be obtained directly from a trading model. In
Example 7.5, I demonstrate this method of estimating the half-life of
mean reversion using our favorite spread between GLD and GDX.
Example 7.5: Calculation of the Half-Life of a Mean-Reverting
Time Series
We can use the mean-reverting spread between GLD and GDX in Example
7.2 to illustrate the calculation of the half-life of its mean reversion. The
MATLAB code is available at epchan.com/book/example7 5.m. (The ﬁrst
part of the program is the same as example7 2.m.)
% === Insert example7 2.m in the beginning here ===
prevz=backshift(1, z); % z at a previous time-step
dz=z-prevz;
dz(1)=[];
prevz(1)=[];
% assumes dz=theta*(z-mean(z))dt+w,
% where w is error term
results=ols(dz, prevz-mean(prevz));theta=results.beta;
halflife=-log(2)/theta


<!-- PAGE 164 -->

142
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
% halflife =
%
%
10.0037
The program ﬁnds that the half-life for mean reversion of the GLD-GDX is
about 10 days, which is approximately how long you should expect to hold
this spread before it becomes proﬁtable.
If you believe that your security is mean reverting, then you also
have a ready-made target price—the mean value of the historical
prices of the security, or µ in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck formula. This
target price can be used together with the half-life as exit signals
(exit when either criterion is met).
Target prices can also be used in the case of momentum models
if you have a fundamental valuation model of a company. But as
fundamental valuation is at best an inexact science, target prices
are not as easily justiﬁed in momentum models as in mean-reverting
models. If it were that easy to proﬁt using target prices based on
fundamental valuation, all investors have to do is to check out stock
analysts’ reports every day to make their investment decisions.
Suppose you are running a trading model, and you entered into
a position based on its signal. Some time later, you run this model
again. If you ﬁnd that the sign of this latest signal is opposite to your
original position (e.g., the latest signal is “buy” when you have an
existing short position), then you have two choices. Either you sim-
ply use the latest signal to exit the existing position and become ﬂat
or you can exit the existing position and then enter into an opposite
position. Either way, you have used a new, more recent entry signal
as an exit signal for your existing position. This is a common way
to generate exit signals when a trading model can be run in shorter
intervals than the optimal holding period.
Notice that this strategy of exiting a position based on running
an entry model also tells us whether a stop-loss strategy is recom-
mended. In a momentum model, when a more recent entry signal
is opposite to an existing position, it means that the direction of
momentum has changed, and thus a loss (or more precisely, a draw-
down) in your position has been incurred. Exiting this position now


<!-- PAGE 165 -->

Special Topics in Quantitative Trading
143
is almost akin to a stop loss. However, rather than imposing an ar-
bitrary stop-loss price and thus introducing an extra adjustable pa-
rameter, which invites data-snooping bias, exiting based on the most
recent entry signal is clearly justiﬁed based on the rationale for the
momentum model.
Consider a parallel situation when we are running a reversal
model. If an existing position has incurred a loss, running the re-
versal model again will simply generate a new signal with the same
sign. Thus, a reversal model for entry signals will never recommend
a stop loss. (On the contrary, it can recommend a target price or
proﬁt cap when the reversal has gone so far as to hit the opposite
entry threshold.) And, indeed, it is much more reasonable to exit
a position recommended by a mean-reversal model based on hold-
ing period or proﬁt cap than stop loss, as a stop loss in this case
often means you are exiting at the worst possible time. (The only
exception is when you believe that you have suddenly entered into
a momentum regime because of recent news.)
SEASONAL TRADING STRATEGIES
This type of trading strategy is also called the calendar effect. Gen-
erally, these strategies recommend that you buy or sell certain secu-
rities at a ﬁxed date of every year, and close the position at another
ﬁxed date. These strategies have been applied to both equity and
commodity futures markets. However, from my own experience,
much of the seasonality in equity markets has weakened or even
disappeared in recent years, perhaps due to the widespread knowl-
edge of this trading opportunity, whereas some seasonal trades in
commodity futures are still proﬁtable.
The most famous seasonal trade in equities is called the January
effect. There are actually many versions of this trade. One ver-
sion states that small-cap stocks that had the worst returns in the
previous calendar year will have higher returns in January than
small-cap stocks that had the best returns (Singal, 2006). The ra-
tionale for this is that investors like to sell their losers in Decem-
ber to beneﬁt from tax losses, which creates additional downward

pressure on their prices. When this pressure disappeared in Jan-
uary, the prices recovered somewhat. This strategy did not work
in 2006–07, but worked wonderfully in January 2008, which was a
spectacular month for mean-reversal strategies. (That January was
the one that saw a major trading scandal at Soci´et´e G´en´erale, which
indirectly may have caused the Federal Reserve to have an emer-
gency 75-basis-point rate cut before the market opened. The turmoil
slaughtered many momentum strategies, but mean-reverting strate-
gies beneﬁted greatly from the initial severe downturn and then dra-
matic rescue by the Fed.) The codes for backtesting this January
effect strategy is given in Example 7.6.

Another seasonal strategy in equities was proposed more
recently (Heston and Sadka, 2007; available at lcb1.uoregon.
edu/rcg/seminars/seasonal072604.pdf). This strategy is very simple:
each month, buy a number of stocks that performed the best in the
same month a year earlier, and short the same number of stocks
that performed poorest in that month a year earlier. The average
annual return before 2002 was more than 13 percent before transac-
tion costs. However, I have found that this effect has disappeared
since then, as you can check for yourself in Example 7.7. (See
the readers’ comments to my blog post epchan.blogspot.com/2007/

You can try the most recent ﬁve years instead of the entire data period, and
you will ﬁnd that the average returns are even worse.
In contrast to equity seasonal strategies, commodity futures’
seasonal strategies are alive and well. That is perhaps because sea-
sonal demand for certain commodities is driven by “real” economic
needs rather than speculations.
One of the most intuitive commodity seasonal trades is the
gasoline future trade: Simply buy the gasoline future contract that
expires in May near the middle of April, and sell it by the end
of April. This trade has been proﬁtable for the last 11 years, as
of this writing in April 2008. (See the sidebar for details.) It ap-
pears that one can always depend on approaching summer driv-
ing seasons in North America to drive up gasoline futures prices in
the spring.

Whenever the summer driving season comes up, it should not surprise us that
gasoline futures prices will be rising seasonally. The only question for the trader
is: which month contract to buy, and to hold for what period? After scanning the
literature, the best trade I have found so far is one where we buy 1 contract of
RB (the unleaded gasoline futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
[NYMEX]) at the close of April 13 (or the following trading day if it is a holiday),
and sell it at the close of April 25 (or the previous trading day if it is a holiday).
Historically, we would have realized a proﬁt every year since 1995. Here is the

future contract that expires in June near the end of February, and
sell it by the middle of April. (Again, see sidebar for details.)

Summer season is also when natural gas demand goes up due to the increasing
demand from power generators to provide electricity for air conditioning. This
suggests a seasonal trade in natural gas where we long a June contract of NYMEX
natural gas futures (Symbol: NG) at the close of February 25 (or the following
trading day if it is a holiday), and exit this position on April 15 (or the previous
trading day if it is a holiday). This trade has been proﬁtable for 14 consecutive
years at of this writing. Here is the annual P&L and maximum drawdown of this
trade, both in backtest and in actual trading:

Natural gas futures are notoriously volatile, and we have seen big trading

banks (e.g., Bank of Montreal, loss = $450 million). Therefore, one should be
cautious if one wants to try out this trade—perhaps at reduced capital using the
mini QG futures at half the size of the full NG contract.

Commodity futures seasonal trades do suffer from one draw-
back despite their consistent proﬁtability: they typically occur only
once a year; therefore, it is hard to tell whether the backtest per-
formance is a result of data-snooping bias. As usual, one way to
alleviate this problem is to try somewhat different entry and exit
dates to see if the proﬁtability holds up. In addition, one should
consider only those trades where the seasonality makes some eco-
nomic sense. The gasoline and natural gas trades amply satisfy these
criteria.
HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING
STRATEGIES
In general, if a high Sharpe ratio is the goal of your trading strategy
(as it should be, given what I said in Chapter 6), then you should be
trading at high frequencies, rather than holding stocks overnight.
What are high-frequency trading strategies, and why do they
have superior Sharpe ratios? Many experts in high-frequency trading
would not regard any strategy that holds positions for more than a
few seconds as high frequency, but here I would take a more pedes-
trian approach and include any strategy that does not hold a po-
sition overnight. Many of the early high-frequency strategies were
applied to the foreign exchange market, and then later on to the fu-
tures market, because of their abundance of liquidity. In the last six
or seven years, however, with the increasing liquidity in the equity
market, the availability of historical tick database for stocks, and
mushrooming computing power, this type of strategies has become
widespread for stock trading as well.
The reason why these strategies have Sharpe ratio is simple:
Based on the “law of large numbers,” the more bets you can place,
the smaller the percent deviation from the mean return you will
experience. With high-frequency trading, one can potentially place
hundreds if not thousands of bets all in one day. Therefore, pro-
vided the strategy is sound and generates positive mean return, you
can expect the day-to-day deviation from this return to be minimal.
With this high Sharpe ratio, one can increase the leverage to a much


<!-- PAGE 174 -->

152
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
higher level than longer-term strategies can, and this high leverage
in turn boosts the return-on-equity of the strategy to often strato-
spheric levels.
Of course, the law of large numbers does not explain why a
particular high-frequency strategy has positive mean return in the
ﬁrst place. In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-
frequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such
strategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-
verting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral
pair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-
eral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in
the market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.
Unlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals
where the market environment can experience upheavals during the
lifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist
day to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-
more, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-
est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The
worst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a
slow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-
tic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple
accounts.
Though successful high-frequency strategies have such numer-
ous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the
average holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.
Transaction costs are of paramount importance in testing such
strategies. Without incorporating transactions, the simplest strate-
gies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just
having high-frequency data with last prices is not sufﬁcient—data
with bid, ask, and last quotes is needed to ﬁnd out the proﬁtability
of executing on the bid versus the ask. Sometimes, we may even
need historical order book information for backtesting. Quite often,
the only true test for such strategies is to run it in real-time unless
one has an extremely sophisticated simulator.


<!-- PAGE 175 -->

Backtesting is only a small part of the game in high-frequency
trading. High-speed execution may account for a large part of the ac-
tual proﬁts or losses. Professional high-frequency trading ﬁrms have
been writing their strategies in C instead of other, more user-friendly
languages, and locating their servers next to the exchange or a ma-
jor Internet backbone to reduce the microsecond delays. So even
though the Sharpe ratio is appealing and the returns astronomical,
truly high-frequency trading is not by any means easy for an inde-
pendent trader to achieve in the beginning. But there is no reason
not to work toward this goal gradually as expertise and resources
accrue.
IS IT BETTER TO HAVE
A HIGH-LEVERAGE VERSUS
A HIGH-BETA PORTFOLIO?
In Chapter 6, I discussed the optimal leverage to apply to a port-
folio based on the Kelly formula. In the section on factor models
earlier in this chapter, I discussed the Fama-French Three-Factor
model, which suggests that return of a portfolio (or a stock) is
proportional to its beta (if we hold the market capitalization and
book value of its stocks ﬁxed). In other words, you can increase
return on a portfolio by either increasing its leverage or increas-
ing its beta (by selecting high-beta stocks.) Both ways seem com-
monsensical. In fact, it is clear that given a low-beta portfolio and
a high-beta portfolio, it is easy to apply a higher leverage on the
low-beta portfolio so as to increase its beta to match that of the
high-beta portfolio. And assuming that the stocks of two portfo-
lios have the same average market capitalizations and book val-
ues, the average returns of the two will also be the same (ignor-
ing speciﬁc returns, which will decrease in importance as long as
we increase the number stocks in the portfolios), according to the
Fama-French model. So should we be indifferent to which portfolio
to own?
The answer is no. Recall in Chapter 6 that the long-term com-
pounded growth rate of a portfolio, if we use the Kelly leverage,


<!-- PAGE 176 -->

154
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
is proportional to the Sharpe ratio squared, and not to the average
return. So if the two hypothetical portfolios have the same average
return, then we would prefer the one that has the smaller risk or
standard deviation. Empirical studies have found that a portfolio
that consists of low-beta stocks generally has lower risk and thus
a higher Sharpe ratio.
For example, in a paper titled “Risk Parity Portfolios” (not pub-
licly distributed), Dr. Edward Qian at PanAgora Asset Management
argued that a typical 60–40 asset allocation between stocks and
bonds is not optimal because it is overweighted with risky assets
(stocks in this case). Instead, to achieve a higher Sharpe ratio while
maintaining the same risk level as the 60–40 portfolio, Dr. Qian rec-
ommended a 23–77 allocation while leveraging the entire portfolio
by 1.8.
Somehow, the market is chronically underpricing high-beta
stocks. Hence, given a choice between a portfolio of high-beta
stocks and a portfolio of low-beta stocks, we should prefer the low-
beta one, which we can then leverage up to achieve the maximum
compounded growth rate.
There is one usual caveat, however. All this is based on the Gaus-
sian assumption of return distributions. (See discussions in Chapter
6 on this issue.) Since the actual returns distributions have fat tails,
one should be quite wary of using too much leverage on normally
low-beta stocks.
SUMMARY
This book has been largely about a particular type of quantitative
trading called statistical arbitrage in the investment industry. De-
spite this fancy name, statistical arbitrage is actually far simpler
than trading derivatives (e.g., options) or ﬁxed-income instruments,
both conceptually and mathematically. I have described a large part
of the statistical arbitrageur’s standard arsenal: mean reversion and
momentum, regime switching, stationarity and cointegration, arbi-
trage pricing theory or factor model, seasonal trading models, and,
ﬁnally, high-frequency trading.

Some of the important points to note can be summarized here:
r Mean-reverting regimes are more prevalent than trending
regimes.
r There are some tricky data issues involved with backtesting
mean-reversion strategies: Outlier quotes and survivorship bias
are among them.
r Trending regimes are usually triggered by the diffusion of new
information, the execution of a large institutional order, or
“herding” behavior.
r Competition between traders tends to reduce the number of
mean-reverting trading opportunities.
r Competition between traders tends to reduce the optimal hold-
ing period of a momentum trade.
r Regime switching can sometimes be detected using a data-
miningx approach with numerous input features.
r A stationary price series is ideal for a mean-reversion trade.
r Two or more nonstationary price series can be combined to
form a stationary one if they are “cointegrating.”
r Cointegration and correlation are different things: Cointegration
is about the long-term behavior of the prices of two or more
stocks, while correlation is about the short-term behavior of
their returns.
r Factor models, or arbitrage pricing theory, are commonly used
for modeling how fundamental factors affect stock returns lin-
early.
r One of the most well-known factor models is the Fama-French
Three-Factor model, which postulates that stock returns are
proportional to their beta and book-to-price ratio, and negatively
to their market capitalizations.
r Factor models typically have a relatively long holding period and
long drawdowns due to regime switches.
r Exit signals should be created differently for mean-reversion
versus momentum strategies.
r Estimation of the optimal holding period of a mean-reverting
strategy can be quite robust, due to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck for-
mula.


<!-- PAGE 178 -->

156
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
r Estimation of the optimal holding period of a momentum strat-
egy can be error prone due to the small number of signals.
r Stop loss can be suitable for momentum strategies but not re-
versal strategies.
r Seasonal trading strategies for stocks (i.e., calendar effect) have
become unproﬁtable in recent years.
r Seasonal trading strategies for commodity futures continue to
be proﬁtable.
r High-frequency trading strategies rely on the “law of large num-
bers” for their high Sharpe ratios.
r High-frequency trading strategies typically generate the highest
long-term compounded growth due to their high Sharpe ratios.
r High-frequency trading strategies are very difﬁcult to backtest
and very technology reliant for their execution.
r Holding a highly leveraged portfolio of low-beta stocks should
generate higher long-term compounded growth than holding un-
leveraged portfolio of high-beta stocks.
Most statistical arbitrage trading strategies are some combina-
tion of these effects or models: Whether they are proﬁtable or not
is more of an issue of where and when to apply them than whether
they are theoretically correct or not.

Conclusion
Can Independent Traders
Succeed?
Q
uantitative trading gained notoriety in the summer of 2007
when some enormous hedge funds run by some of the most
reputable money managers rung up losses measured in bil-
lions in just a few days (though some had recovered by the end of
the month). They brought back bad memories of other notorious
hedge fund debacles such as that of Long-Term Capital Management
and Amaranth Advisors (both referenced in Chapter 6), except that
this time it was not just one trader or one ﬁrm, but losses at multiple
funds over a short period of time.
And yet, ever since I began my career in the institutional quanti-
tative trading business, I have spoken to many small, independent
traders, working in shabby ofﬁces or their spare bedrooms, who
gain small but steady and growing proﬁts year-in and year-out, quite
unlike the stereotypical reckless day traders of the popular imagi-
nation. In fact, many independent traders that I know of have not
only survived the periods when big funds lost billions, but actually
thrived in those times. This has been the central mystery of trading
to me for many years: how does an independent trader with insignif-
icant equity and minimal infrastructure trade with high Sharpe ratio
while ﬁrms with all-star teams fail spectacularly?
157

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
At the beginning of 2006, I left the institutional money manage-
ment business and struck out on my own to experience this ﬁrst-
hand. I ﬁgured that if I could not trade proﬁtably when I was free of
all institutional constraints and politics, then either trading is a hoax
or I am just not cut out to be a trader. Either way, I promised myself
that in such an event I would quit trading forever. Fortunately, I sur-
vived. Along the way, I also found the key to that central mystery to
which I alluded earlier.
The key, it turns out, is capacity, a concept I introduced at the
end of Chapter 2. (To recap: Capacity is the amount of equity a strat-
egy can generate good returns on.) It is far, far easier to generate
a high Sharpe ratio trading a $100,000 account than a $100 million
account. There are many simple and proﬁtable strategies that can
work at the low capacity end that would be totally unsuitable to
hedge funds. This is the niche for independent traders like us.
Let me elaborate on this capacity issue. Most proﬁtable strate-
gies that have low capacities are acting as market makers: provid-
ing short-term liquidity when it is needed and taking quick proﬁts
when the liquidity need disappears. If, however, you have billions
of dollars to manage, you now become the party in need of liquid-
ity, and you have to pay for it. To minimize the cost of this liquidity
demand, you necessarily have to hold your positions over long pe-
riods of time. When you hold for long periods, your portfolio will
be subject to macroeconomic changes (i.e., regime shifts) that can
cause great damage to your portfolio. Though you may still be prof-
itable in the long run if your models are sound, you cannot avoid the
occasional sharp drawdowns that attract newspaper headlines.
Other disadvantages beset large-capacity strategies favored by
large institutions. The intense competition among hedge funds
means the strategies become less proﬁtable. The lowered returns
in turn pressure the fund manager to overleverage. To beat out the
competition, traders need to resort to more and more complicated
models, which in turn invite data-snooping bias. But despite the in-
creasing complexity of the models, the fundamental market inefﬁ-
ciency that they are trying to exploit may remain the same, and thus
their portfolios may still end up holding very similar positions. We
discussed this phenomenon in Chapter 6. When market environment


<!-- PAGE 181 -->

changes, a stampede out of similar losing positions can (and did)
cause a complete meltdown of the market.
Another reason that independent traders can often succeed
when large funds fail is the myriad constraints imposed by man-
agement in an institutional setting. For example, as a trader in a
quantitative fund, you may be prohibited from trading a long-only
strategy, but long-only strategies are often easier to ﬁnd, simpler,
more proﬁtable, and if traded in small sizes, no more risky than
market-neutral strategies. Or you may be prohibited from trading
futures. You may be required to be not only market neutral but
also sector neutral. You may be asked to ﬁnd a momentum strat-
egy when you know that a mean-reverting strategy would work.
And on and on. Many of these constraints are imposed for risk
management reasons, but many others may be just whims, quirks,
and prejudices of the management. As every student of mathe-
matical optimization knows, any constraint imposed on an opti-
mization problem decreases the optimal objective value. Similarly,
every institutional constraint imposed on a trading strategy tends to
decrease its returns, if not its Sharpe ratio as well. Finally, some
senior managers who oversee frontline portfolio managers of quan-
titative funds are actually not well versed in quantitative techniques,
and they tend to make decisions based on anything but quantitative
theories.
When your strategy shows initial proﬁts, these managers may
impose enormous pressure for you to scale up quickly, and when
your strategy starts to lose, they may force you to liquidate the port-
folios and abandon the strategy immediately. None of these inter-
ferences in the quantitative investment process is mathematically
optimal.
Besides, such managers often have a mercurial temper, which
seldom mixes well with quantitative investment management. When
loss of money occurs, rationality is often the ﬁrst victim.
As an independent trader, you are free from such constraints
and interferences, and as long as you are emotionally capable to
adhere to the discipline of quantitative trading, your trading envi-
ronment may actually be closer to the optimal than that of a large
fund.


<!-- PAGE 182 -->

QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Actually, there is one more reason why it is easier for hedge
funds to blow up than for individual traders trading their own ac-
counts to do so. When one is trading other people’s money, one’s
upside is almost unlimited, while the downside is simply to get ﬁred.
Hence, despite the pro forma adherence to stringent institutional
risk management procedures and constraints, one is fundamentally
driven to trade strategies that are more risky in an institutional set-
ting, as long as you can sneak past the risk manager. But Mr. J´erˆome
Kerviel at Soci´et´e G´en´erale has shown us that this is not at all
difﬁcult!
L’Affaire Soci´et´e G´en´erale cost the bank $7.1 billion and may
have indirectly led to an emergency Fed rate cut in the United States.
The bank’s internal controls failed to discover the rogue trades for
three years because Mr. Kerviel has worked in the back ofﬁce and
has gained great familiarity with ways to evade the control proce-
dures (Clark, 2008).
In fact, Mr. Kerviel’s deceptive technique is by no means original.
When I was working at a large investment bank, there was a pair of
proprietary traders who traded quantitatively. They were enclosed
in a glass bubble at a corner of the vast trading ﬂoor, either because
they could not be bothered by the hustle and bustle of the nonquan-
titative traders, or they had to keep their trade secrets, well, secret.
As far as I could tell, neither of them ever talked to anyone. Nor, it
seemed, did they ever speak to each other.
One day, one of the traders disappeared, never to return. Shortly
thereafter, hordes of auditors were searching through his ﬁles and
computers. It turned out that, just like Mr. Kerviel, this trader had
worked in the information technology (IT) department and was
quite computer savvy. He managed to manufacture many millions
of false proﬁts without anyone’s questioning him until, one day, a
computer crash somehow stopped his rogue program in its track
and exposed his activities. Rumor had it that he disappeared to In-
dia and has been enjoying the high life ever since.
So there you have it. I hope I have made a convincing case that
independent traders can gain an edge over institutional traders, if
trading is conducted with discipline and care. Of course, the side
beneﬁts of being independent are numerous, and they begin with


<!-- PAGE 183 -->

freedom. Personally, I am much happier with my work now than I
have ever been in my career, despite the inevitable gut-wrenching
drawdowns from time to time.
NEXT STEPS
So let’s say you have found a few good, simple strategies and are
happily trading in your spare bedroom. Where do you go from here?
How do you grow?
Actually, I discussed growth in Chapter 6, but in a limited sense.
Using the Kelly formula, you can indeed achieve exponential growth
of your equity, but only up to the total capacity of your strategies. Af-
ter that, the source of growth has to come from increasing the num-
ber of strategies. You can, for example, look for strategies that trade
at higher frequencies than the ones you currently have. To do that,
you have to invest and upgrade your technological infrastructure,
and purchase expensive high-frequency historical data. Or, con-
versely, you can look for strategies that hold longer periods. Despite
their typically lower Sharpe ratios, they do enormously improve
your capacity. For many of these strategies, you probably have to
invest in expensive historical fundamental data for your backtest.
If you are an equity trader, you can branch out into futures or
currencies, which typically have higher capacities than equity mod-
els. If you run out of ideas or lack expertise in a new market that you
want to enter, you can form collaborations with other like-minded
traders, or you can hire consultants to help with the research. If you
are running too many strategies to manage manually on your own,
you can push your automation further so that there is no need for
you to manually intervene in the daily trading unless exceptions or
problems occur. Of course, you can also hire a trader to monitor all
these strategies for you.
These investments in data, infrastructure, and personnel are all
part of reinvesting some of your earnings to further the growth of
your trading business, not unlike growing any other type of busi-
ness. When you have reached a point where your capacity is higher
than what the Kelly formula suggests you can prudently utilize, it


<!-- PAGE 184 -->

162
QUANTITATIVE TRADING
may be time for you to start taking on investors, who will at the very
least defray the costs of your infrastructure, if not provide an incen-
tive fee. Alternatively, you might want to take your strategy (and,
more importantly, your track record) to one of the larger hedge
funds and ask for a proﬁt-sharing contract.
After the recent major losses at quantitative hedge funds, many
people have started to wonder if quantitative trading is viable in the
long term. Though the talk of the demise of quantitative strategies
appears to be premature at this point, it is still an important ques-
tion from the perspective of an independent trader. Once you have
automated everything and your equity is growing exponentially, can
you just sit back, relax, and enjoy your wealth? Unfortunately, ex-
perience tells us that strategies do lose their potency over time as
more traders catch on to them. It takes ongoing research to supply
you with new strategies.
There are always upheavals and major regime changes that may
occur once every decade but will nevertheless cause sudden deaths
to certain strategies. As with any commercial endeavor, a period of
rapid growth will inevitably be followed by the steady if unspectac-
ular returns of a mature business. As long as ﬁnancial markets de-
mand instant liquidity, however, there will always be a proﬁtable
niche for quantitative trading.

A Quick Survey
of MATLAB
M
ATLAB is a general-purpose software package developed
by Mathworks, Inc., which is used by many institutional
quantitative researchers and traders as their platform for
backtesting, particularly those that work in statistical arbitrage. In
Chapter 3, I introduced this platform and compared its pros and
cons with some other alternatives. Most of the strategy examples
in this book are written in MATLAB. Many of those strategies are
portfolio-trading strategies involving hundreds of stocks that are
very difﬁcult to backtest in Excel. Here, I will provide a quick survey
of MATLAB for those traders who are unfamiliar with the language,
so they can see if it is worthwhile for them to invest in acquiring and
learning to use this platform for their own backtesting.
MATLAB is not only a programming language; it is also an inte-
grated development platform that includes a very user-friendly pro-
gram editor and debugger. It is an interpreted language, meaning
that similar to Visual Basic, but unlike a conventional programming
language like C, it does not need to be compiled before it can be
run. Yet it is much more ﬂexible and powerful for backtesting than
using Excel or Visual Basic because of the large number of built-
in functions useful for mathematical computations, and because it
is an array-processing language that is specially designed to make
163


<!-- PAGE 186 -->

164
APPENDIX
computations on arrays (i.e., vectors or matrices) simply and
quickly. In particular, many loops that are necessary in C or Visual
Basic can be replaced by just one line of code in MATLAB. It also
includes extensive text processing facilities such that it is useful as
a powerful tool for parsing and analyzing texts (such as web pages).
Furthermore, it has a comprehensive graphics library that enables
easy plotting of many types of graphs, even animations. (Many of
the ﬁgures and charts in this book are created using MATLAB.) Fi-
nally, MATLAB codes can be compiled into C or C++ executables
that can run on computers without the MATLAB platform installed.
In fact, there is third-party software that can convert MATLAB code
into C source codes, too.
The basic syntax of MATLAB is very similar to Visual Basic or C.
For example, we can initialize the elements of an array x like this:
x(1)=0.1;
x(2)=0.3;
% 3 elements of an array initialized.
% This is by default a row-vector
x(3)=0.2;
Note that we don’t need to ﬁrst “declare” this array, nor do we
need to tell MATLAB its expected size beforehand. If you leave out
the “;” sign, MATLAB will print out the result of the content of the
variable being assigned a value. Any comments can be written after
the “%” sign. If you wish, you can initialize a large number of ele-
ments en masse to a common value:
% assigning the value 0.8 to all elements of a 3-vector y.
This is a row-vector.y=0.8*ones(1, 3)
Now if you want to do a vector addition of the two vectors, you
can do it the old-fashioned way (just as you would in C), that is,
using a loop:
for i=1:3
z(i)=x(i)+y(i) % z is [0.9 1.1 1]
end
But the power of MATLAB is that it can handle many array oper-
ations in parallel very succinctly, without using loops. (That’s why it


<!-- PAGE 187 -->

A Quick Survey of MATLAB
165
is called a vector-processing language.) So instead of the loop above,
you can just write
z=x+y % z is the same [0.9 1.1 1]
Even more powerful, you can easily select part of the different
arrays and operate on them. What do you think would be the results
of the following?
w=x([1 3])+z([2 1])
x([1 3]) selected the ﬁrst and third elements of x, so x([1 3]) is
just [0.1 0.2]. z([2 1]) selected the second and ﬁrst elements of y, in
that order, so z([2 1]) is [1.1 0.9]. So w is [1.2 1.1].
You can delete parts of an array just as easily:
x([1 3])=[] % this leaves x as [0.3]
To concatenate two arrays is also trivial. To concatenate by
rows, use the “;” to separate the arrays:
u=[z([1 1]); w]
% u is now
% [0.9000
0.9000;
% 1.2000
1.1000]
To concatenate by columns, omit the “;”:
v=[z([1 1]) w]
% v is now
% [0.9000
0.9000
1.2000
1.1000]
Selection of a subarray can be done not only with arrays con-
taining indices; it can be done with arrays containing logical values
as well. For example, here is a logical array:
vlogical=v<1.1
% vlogical is [1 1 0 0], where the 0s and 1’s
% indicate whether that element is less than 1.1 or
% not.
vlt=v(vlogical) % vlt is [0.9 0.9]


<!-- PAGE 188 -->

166
APPENDIX
In fact, we can select the same subarray with the oft-used short-
hand
vlt=v(v<1.1) % vlt is the same [0.9 0.9]
If, for some reasons, you are interested in the actual indices of
the elements of v that have value less than 1.1, you can use the “ﬁnd”
function:
idx=find(v<1.1); % idx is [1 2]
Naturally, you can use this index array to select the same sub-
array as before:
vlt=v(idx); % vlt is the again same [0.9 0.9]
So far, the array examples are all one-dimensional. But of
course, MATLAB can deal with multidimensional arrays as well.
Here is a two-dimensional example:
x=[1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];

You can select the entire row or column of multi-dimensional
array by using the “:” symbol. For example,
xr1=x(1,:) % xr1 is the first row of x, i.e. xr1 is [1 2 3]
xc2=x(:, 2)% xc2 is the second column of x, i.e. xc2 is
% 2
% 5
% 8
Naturally, you can delete an entire row from an array using the
same method.
x(1,:) =[] % x is now just [4 5 6; 7 8 9]

The transpose of a matrix is indicated by a simple ‘′’. So the
transpose of x is just x′, which is

Elements of arrays do not have to be numbers. They can be
strings, or even arrays themselves. This kind of arrays is called cell
array in MATLAB. In the following example, C is just such a cell
array:
C={[1 2 3]; [‘a’ ‘b’ ‘c’ ‘d’]}
% C is
% [1 2 3]
% ‘abcd’
One of the beauties of MATLAB is that practically all built-in
functions can work on all elements of arrays concurrently. For ex-
ample,
log(x) % this gives
% 1.3863
1.6094
1.7918
% 1.9459
2.0794
2.1972
There are a large number of such built-in functions. Some of the
ones I have used are:
sum, cumsum, diag, max, min, mean, std, corrcoef,
repmat, reshape, squeeze, sort, sortrow, rand, size,
length, eigs,
fix, round, floor, ceil, mod,
factorial, setdiff, union, intersect, ismember,
unique, any, all, eval, eye, ones, strmatch, regexp,
regexprep, plot, hist, bar, scatter, try, catch,
circshift, datestr, datenum,
isempty, isfinite,
isnan, islogical, randperm
If the built-in functions of the basic MATLAB platform do not
meet all your needs, you can always purchase additional tool-
boxes from MATLAB. Some of the toolboxes useful to quanti-
tative traders are the optimization, partial differential equations

APPENDIX
(for derivative traders), genetic algorithms, statistics, neural net-
works, signal processing, wavelet, ﬁnancial, ﬁnancial derivatives,
GARCH, ﬁnancial times series, datafeed, and ﬁxed-income tool-
boxes. If these toolboxes are too costly, or if they still do not meet
all your needs, there are also a number of free user-contributed tool-
boxes available for download from the Internet. I have introduced
one of them in this book: the Econometrics toolbox developed by
James LeSage (www.spatial-econometrics.com). There are a num-
ber of others that I have used before: the Bayes Net toolbox from
Kevin Murphy (www.cs.ubc.ca/∼murphyk/Software/BNT/bnt.html),
or the GARCH toolbox from Kevin Sheppard (www.kevinsheppard.
org/research/ucsd garch/ucsd garch.aspx). The easy availability of
these user-contributed toolboxes and the large community of MAT-
LAB users from whom you can ask for help greatly enhance the use-
fulness of MATLAB as a computational platform.
You can, of course, write your own functions in MATLAB, too. I
have given a number of example functions in this book, all of which
can be downloaded from my web site, www.epchan.com/book. In
fact, it is very helpful for you to develop your own library of utilities
functions that you often use for constructing trading strategies. As
this homegrown library grows, your productivity in developing new
strategies will increase as well.

Praise for  Quantitative Trading
“As technology has evolved, so has the ease in developing trading strategies. Ernest Chan does all 
traders, current and prospective, a real service by succinctly outlining the tremendous beneﬁ ts, but also 
some of the pitfalls, in utilizing many of the recently implemented quantitative trading techniques.”
—PETER BORISH, Chairman and CEO, Computer Trading Corporation
“Dr. Ernest Chan provides an optimal framework for strategy development, back-testing, risk management, 
programming knowledge, and real-time system implementation to develop and run an algorithmic trading 
business step by step in Quantitative Trading.”
—YASER ANWAR, trader
“Quantitative systematic trading is a challenging ﬁ eld that has always been shrouded in mystery, 
seemingly too difﬁ cult to master by all but an elite few. In this honest and practical guide, Dr. Chan 
highlights the essential cornerstones of a successful automated trading operation and shares lessons he 
learned the hard way while offering clear direction to steer readers away from common traps that both 
individual and institutional traders often succumb to.”
—ROSARIO M. INGARGIOLA, CTO, Alphacet, Inc.
“This book provides valuable insight into how private investors can establish a solid structure for success 
in algorithmic trading. Ernie’s extensive hands-on experience in building trading systems is invaluable for 
aspiring traders who wish to take their knowledge to the next level.”
—RAMON CUMMINS, private investor
“Out of the many books and articles on quantitative trading that I’ve read over the years, very few have 
been of much use at all. In most instances, the authors have no real knowledge of the subject matter, or do 
have something important to say but are unwilling to do so because of fears of having trade secrets stolen. 
Ernie subscribes to a different credo: Share meaningful information and have meaningful interactions 
with the quantitative community at large. Ernie successfully distills a large amount of detailed and difﬁ cult 
subject matter down to a very clear and comprehensive resource for novice and pro alike.”
