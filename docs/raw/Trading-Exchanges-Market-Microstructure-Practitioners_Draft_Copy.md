Acknowledgements 
Many people contributed to the success of this project with their encouragement, advice, 
knowledge, and expertise.  I would not have started this project without their interest, and I 
would not have completed it without their support.  The book is much better for their 
contributions.   
I received my first encouragement as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, long before 
I knew anything about market microstructure.  Professor Arnold Zellner advised me to publish a 
book based on lectures I would give when I became a professor.  Although it seemed 
unimaginable to me at the time, I never forgot his advice or his confidence in me.  I look forward 
to the time when I will read a book written by one of my students.  
Several publishers suggested that I write this book.  I particularly appreciate the interest shown 
by editors Mike Junior, Randall Adams, Maureen Riopelle, Kenneth MacLeod, and Paul 
Donnelly.  I have no doubt that they all would have been very helpful in the development of this 
book.  I regret that I could not work with them all.  Their encouragement, enthusiasm, and vision 
helped kindle and sustain my interest.   
This book would not have been possible without the many insights that I learned from my 
academic colleagues.  I especially appreciate the lessons that they taught me, and the strong 
expressions of interest and valuable constructive criticism that they have given me.  I wish to

Four people particularly influenced the development of this book.  Wayne Wagner thoroughly 
reviewed an early draft of the manuscript.  His suggestions greatly improved every part of the 
book.  Craig Holden used early drafts of the text in his trading course at Indiana University.  I am 
especially indebted to him for the confidence and vision he expressed to various publishers.  
Ananth Madhavan commented on early drafts of the book and supplied many bibliographic 
references.  I have greatly appreciated having him as a colleague at USC.  Finally, Jack Treynor 
was instrumental in helping me appreciate the importance of the zero-sum game in trading.  Most 
principles of market microstructure somehow involve properties of zero-sum games. 
Several generous sponsors provided financial support for this project.  I received “angel 
financing” from the New York Stock Exchange (Dick Grasso, Billy Johnston, Jim Cochrane, and 
George Sofianos), the Jefferies Group (Frank Baxter), Mellon Capital Management Corporation 
(Bill Fouse and Tom Loeb), Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (Bernie and Peter Madoff), 
First Canada Securities International (Jim Medlock), Cantor Fitzgerald (Stuart Fraser and Phil 
Ginsberg), and First Quadrant (Rob Arnott).  Their early support allowed me to take time off 
from my teaching to start this project.  I am also grateful to Oxford University Press who 
provided a developmental grant with which I was able to pay research assistants.   
I appreciate the support provided to me by the USC Marshall School of Business through the 
Fred V. Keenan Chair in Finance.  The generosity of our donors has been instrumental to the 
remarkable development of our faculty, School, and University over the last ten years under the 
leadership of Marshall School deans Jack Borsting and Randolph Westerfield and USC president 
Steven B. Sample.  Our most important accomplishments appear in the largely unseen influences 
that we have upon our students, and upon the policymakers and business executives who rely 
upon our research when making significant decisions.  Our work rarely provides us with suitable 
opportunities to thank everyone who makes it possible.  I am grateful for this opportunity to 
thank our donors for their confidence, vision, and support.  I am especially pleased to recognize 
Fred Keenan, whose loyalty and generous support to the University have been an inspiration to 
us all.  
Many people at USC helped me with the preparation of the manuscript.  I am grateful both for 
their contributions to this book and for teaching me to write better.  I gratefully thank my 
research assistants, Namrata Aggarwal, Chris Bandouveris, Claire Yu Cui, Shane Enete, Cynthia 
Lee, Jeff Lin, Jennifer Ly, Anna Nguyen, Venky Panchapagesan, and Jia Ye; and my 
departmental assistants Deborah Jacobs, Marilyn Johnson, Terry Lichvar, and Helen Pitts.  I am 
particularly pleased to recognize Cynthia Lee for her very extensive assistance with grammar, 
style, and proofreading.   
Several people were notably helpful with proofreading early drafts.  I thank Jennifer Chang, 
Abby Harris, Naftali Harris, Hai Lu, and Joey Engelberg for the careful attention that they paid 
to the manuscript.

My family and friends also contributed to the successful completion of this book in more ways 
that would be appropriate to list here.  I particularly appreciate the support given to me by Alex 
Baskin, Jack Birns, Brian Greene, Bernard Harris, Devera Harris, Sam Jason, and Alissa Rimon.  
My wife and children were especially supportive.  Without their support, I would not have 
attempted or completed this project. 
My editors at Oxford University Press, Paul Donnelly and <<copy editor>> …  
Finally, I am indebted to the many students at USC who studied with me in my Trading and 
Exchanges course.  Their interest in trading encouraged me to first offer the course in 1991.  This 
book grew out the lectures that developed to present the course to them.  The lessons that I 
learned from my students while teaching Trading and Exchanges greatly influenced the 
organization and presentation of the topics that appear in this book.  I believe that I have learned 
more from my students than from anyone else.   
I have inevitably failed to acknowledge many people who richly deserve it.  Regrettably, the 
ability to easily remember names is not one of the many gifts that I enjoy.  Please forgive me for 
my oversight.   
Thank you to everyone who has helped make this project successful.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
Markets are fascinating.  They change constantly as prices adjust to new information, as winning 
traders replace losing traders, and as new technologies evolve.   
Highly skilled professional traders employ clever strategies in their search for trading profits.  
They ultimately profit from investors, gamblers, and foolish traders.   
The stakes in some markets are very high.  Traders may arrange multimillion-dollar trades in 
seconds.  They sometimes make or lose fortunes overnight. 
The prices that traders negotiate ultimately determine how market-based economies allocate their 
scarce resources.  Free economies owe much of their wealth to their well functioning markets. 
1.1 Scope of the Book 
This book is about trading, the people who trade securities and contracts, the marketplaces where 
they trade, and the rules that govern trading.  You will learn about investors, brokers, dealers, 
arbitrageurs, retail traders, day traders, rogue traders, and gamblers; exchanges, boards of trade, 
dealer networks, ECNs (electronic communications networks), crossing markets, and pink 
sheets; single price auctions, open outcry auctions, and brokered markets; limit orders, market 
orders, and stop orders; program trades, block trades, and short trades; price priority, time 
precedence, public order precedence, and display precedence; insider trading, scalping, and 
bluffing; and investing, speculating, and gambling.  This book will teach you the origins of 
liquidity, transaction costs, volatility, informative prices, and trader profits. 
This book is not about the securities and contracts that people trade.  We will not consider how 
to value them, who should trade them, how to design them, or how to issue them.  Books about 
investments and corporate finance examine these questions. 
Market microstructure is the branch of financial economics that investigates trading and the 
organization of markets.  This field of study has substantially grown in size and importance since 
the October 1987 stock market crash.   
This book presents the economics of market microstructure in simple English prose.  Although 
some simple mathematics and graphics appear in a few supplementary examples, I fully explain 
all essential concepts in the main text. 
1.2 Objectives 
This book will help you understand how markets work, and how governments and exchanges 
regulate them.  You will learn how prices come to reflect information about fundamental values, 
who makes markets liquid, and why some traders consistently profit from trading while others 
lose.  You will be able to predict how various trading rules affect price efficiency, liquidity, and 
trading profits.  Finally, you will understand the forces that govern regulatory processes.  
With this knowledge, you can improve your trading strategies, and you can better manage the 
brokers who work for you.  If you are—or aspire to be—a regulator or an exchange official, this 
knowledge will help you design better markets.

The primary objectives of this book are to understand the origins of the following characteristics 
of market quality:  
• Liquidity.  Traders and regulators often talk about liquidity, but they are rarely careful about 
what they mean.  This book explains what liquidity is, and where it comes from.  If you 
intend to offer or take liquidity, you must understand liquidity.  
• Transaction costs.  Traders must effectively manage their transaction costs to trade 
successfully.  This book explains how to measure and manage transaction costs.  If you trade 
actively, you must understand transaction costs. 
• Informative prices.  Speculators must understand how and when prices become informative 
to trade successfully.  Informative prices are essential to the wealth of our economy.  This 
book explains the processes by which prices become informative.  If you intend to speculate, 
you must understand price efficiency.   
• Volatility.  Traders care about volatility because it can have a significant impact on their 
wealth.  This book explains how prices become volatile, and how regulators try to control 
volatility.  If risk scares you, you must understand volatility. 
• Trading profits.  Trading is a zero-sum game in which some traders win and others lose.  
Traders who do not expect to win should refrain from trading.  This book explains why some 
traders consistently win while other traders consistently lose.  If trading profits interest you—
whether you manage your trading yourself or have someone manage it for you—you must 
understand what determines trading profits.  
The secondary objective of this book is to understand how market structure—trading rules and 
information systems—affect each of these five market characteristics. 
1.3 Instruments and Markets 
Market microstructure examines organized trading in instruments.  Instruments include common 
stocks, preferred stocks, bonds, convertible bonds, warrants, options, futures contracts, forward 
contracts, foreign exchange contracts, swaps, reinsurance contracts, commodities, pollution 
credits, water rights, and even many betting contracts.  Most ideas discussed in this book apply 
equally well to trading in all these instruments. 
Legislatures and judges have created numerous legal definitions of the term “security.”  These 
definitions often distinguish between instruments that represent ownership of assets like stocks 
and bonds (usually called securities) and instruments that derive their values from commodities 
or from other security values (derivative contracts).  They also universally exclude betting 
contracts.  We will pay attention to these distinctions only when they affect the markets through 
the regulatory process. 
A market is the place where traders gather to trade instruments.  That place may be a physical 
trading floor, or it may be an electronic system in which traders can easily communicate with 
each other.  The New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the 
EuroNext Amsterdam Options Exchange are examples of markets where traders meet on trading 
floors.  Nasdaq, the Euronext, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, and the interbank foreign 
exchange market are examples of electronically linked markets.  This book considers how 
trading markets are organized, and how their rules affect traders.

1.4 A Brief Overview of Trading and Exchanges 
This section provides a brief overview of some main points introduced in this book.  It provides 
you with an outline of what you can expect to learn from this book.  Do not be alarmed if you do 
not understand it all now.  The remainder of the book explains everything in detail.  
Trading is a search problem.  Buyers must find sellers, and sellers must find buyers.  Every 
trader wants to trade at a good price.  Sellers seek buyers willing to pay high prices.  Buyers seek 
sellers willing to sell at low prices.  Traders also must find traders who are willing to trade the 
quantities, or sizes, they desire.  Traders who want to trade large quantities may have to find 
many willing traders to complete their trades. 
Dealers and brokers help people trade.  Dealers trade with their clients when their clients want to 
trade.  The prices at which a dealer will buy and sell are the dealers’ bid and ask prices.  After 
they trade with their clients, dealers then try to trade out at a profit by selling what they have 
bought or by buying back what they have sold.  In effect, clients pay dealers to take their trading 
problems.  The dealers then try to solve them at a profit.  Dealers profit by buying low and 
selling high.  Successful dealers must be excellent traders. 
Brokers are agents that arrange trades for their clients.  They help their clients find traders who 
are willing to trade with them.  They profit by charging commissions.   
Patient traders obtain better prices than impatient traders do because they are willing to search 
longer and harder to arrange their trades at favorable terms.  Impatient traders pay for the 
privilege of trading when they want to trade.   
Traders who offer to trade give other people options to trade.  These options sometimes are quite 
valuable.  Traders who expose their offers can lose to clever traders who use various front-
running trading strategies to extract these option values.  Traders therefore must expose their 
offers very carefully.  They should expose only to traders who are most likely to trade with them. 
Traders who trade only to accommodate other traders risk trading with, and losing to, well-
informed speculators.  Speculators are traders who trade to profit from information they have 
about future prices.  Well-informed speculators can predict futures prices better than other traders 
can.  They then choose to buy or sell based upon which side they expect will be profitable.  
Dealers lose to well-informed speculators because they end up being on the wrong side of the 
trade.  Prices tend to move against their positions before they can trade out of them.  All traders 
try to avoid trading with well-informed speculators.   
Dealers recover their losses to informed speculators by widening the spread between the bid and 
ask prices at which they will buy and sell.  Uninformed traders therefore pay more for their 
trades when dealers lose a lot to informed traders.  In effect, uninformed traders lose to well-
informed traders through the intermediation of dealers. 
Traders who can estimate fundamental values cause prices to reflect their value estimates.  They 
buy when price is below their value estimates and sell when price is above.  Their buying pushes 
prices up, and their selling pulls prices down.  They do not trade if they believe that prices reflect 
values.  Well-informed traders make prices informative.  
Bluffers can sometimes fool uninformed traders into trading unwisely.  In general, they can 
profit if the price impacts of their buying and selling are not exactly opposite to each other.

Since dealers may trade when bluffers want them to trade, dealers must be highly disciplined to 
avoid losing to bluffers.   
Trading is a zero-sum game when gains and losses are measured relative to the market average.  
In a zero-sum game, someone can win only if somebody else loses.  On average, well-informed 
speculators and bluffers win, and poorly informed traders and foolish traders lose.  Informed 
traders can only profit to the extent that less informed traders are willing to lose to them. 
Poorly informed traders trade for many reasons.  Investors use the markets to move money from 
the present to the future.  Borrowers do the opposite.  Hedgers trade to manage financial risks 
they face.  Asset exchangers trade one asset for another they value more.  Gamblers trade to 
entertain themselves.   
Exchanges and brokerages design markets to minimize the search costs of trading.  They usually 
organize markets so that everyone who wants to trade gathers at the same place.  A common 
gathering place helps traders find those traders who will offer the best prices.   
Exchanges and brokerages once exclusively organized their markets on physical trading floors.  
Now they can organize their markets within computerized communications networks that allow 
buyers and sellers to arrange their trades remotely.  Electronic marketplaces have rapidly 
expanded as the costs of electronic communications technologies have dropped.  
Most traders want to trade in well-established markets because other traders trade there.  When 
many traders trade in the same place, arranging trades is very easy.  The attraction of traders to 
other traders makes it hard to start new markets. 
Entrepreneurs create new markets when old markets do not adequately meet the needs of a 
significant set of traders.  Since traders face a diversity of trading problems, no single market can 
best meet every trader’s needs.  Many diverse markets may form as exchanges and brokerages 
compete to attract traders.   
Arbitrageurs ensure that prices do not vary much across markets.  When prices diverge, they buy 
in cheaper markets and sell in more expensive markets.  The effect of their trading is to connect 
sellers in cheaper markets to buyers in more expensive markets.   
An exchange’s trading rules affect the quality of its markets.  They determine the balance of 
power between informed traders and uninformed traders, between public traders and professional 
traders, and between large traders and small traders.  Trading rules are very important. 
Markets work best when they trade fungible instruments.  An instrument is fungible if one unit (a 
share, a bond, a contract, …) of the instrument is economically indistinguishable from all other 
units.  If so, buyers do not care which units they receive.  Since all sellers offer identical units, 
buyers can buy from any seller who offers an attractive price.  Sellers likewise can sell to any 
buyer.  Fungible instruments therefore are easier to trade than are instruments that have 
idiosyncratic characteristics.  In derivative markets, the benefits of fungible instruments cause 
trading to concentrate in just a few standardized contracts.  
1.5 Key Recurrent Themes 
A number of important issues repeatedly appear throughout this book.  This section identifies 
these issues.  Watch for them as you read this book.

Information asymmetries.  Traders who know more about values and traders who know more 
about what other traders intend to do have a great advantage over those who do not.  Well-
informed traders profit at the expense of less informed traders.  Less informed traders therefore 
try to avoid well-informed traders.  Pay attention to who is well informed and to how traders 
learn about values. 
Options.  The option to trade is valuable.  People who write limit orders give free trading 
options to other traders.  Clever traders can extract the value of these options.  Pay attention to 
when traders create trading options and to how they prevent other traders from extracting their 
values.  
Externalities.  People create positive externalities when they do something that benefits other 
people without compensation.  People create negative externalities when they do something that 
harms other people without penalty.  The most important externality in market microstructure is 
the order flow externality.  Traders who offer to trade give other traders valuable options to trade 
for which they are not compensated.  The order flow externality attracts and binds traders to 
markets because traders want to benefit from free trading options.  Pay close attention to when, 
why, and how traders offer to trade.  Pay attention also to how markets, brokerages, and dealers 
benefit from the order flow externality.  
Market structure.  Market structure consists of the trading rules, the physical layout, the 
information presentation systems, and the information communication systems of a market.  
Market structure determines what traders can do, and what they can know.  It therefore affects 
trader strategies, the power relationships among different types of traders, and ultimately trader 
profitability.  Always consider what effects market structures have on trading strategies and on 
the balance of power between various types of traders.   
Competition with free entry and exit.  Traders compete in markets to make profits.  Trading 
strategies that generate large profits attract traders who want to participate in those profits.  Their 
entry lowers the profits that everyone makes, on average.  Conversely, traders quit using trading 
strategies that are not profitable, which allows remaining traders to make more profits on 
average.  Free entry and exit ensures that alternative trading strategies produce equal net profits, 
on average, after accounting for all costs.  Wherever you see people competing, consider how the 
costs of entry and exit affect their ability to maintain profits or avoid losses.  This principle will 
help you understand the determinants of bid/ask spreads, dealer profits, informed trader profits, 
and order submission strategies.   
Communications and computing technologies.  Markets are essentially information processing 
mechanisms.  They process information about who wants to trade, how much, and at what prices.  
The resulting prices aggregate information about fundamental values.  The growth in information 
technologies has changed and will continue to change how people trade.  Pay attention to the role 
of information processing technologies in the markets.  
Price correlations.  Markets for similar instruments are closely related.  They tend to have 
similar market conditions, and they often compete fiercely with each other for order flow.  The 
order flow externality generally ensures that one market among a set of closely related markets 
will eventually dominate the others.  Pay attention to markets that trade similar instruments and 
to the differences among them that make them unique.  These issues affect how markets compete 
with each other.

Principal-agent problems.  Principal-agent problems arise when agents do what they want to do 
rather than what their principals want them to do.  The most important principal-agent problem 
in market microstructure involves brokers and their clients.  Brokers do not always do what you 
want them to do, and they may not work as hard on your behalf as you would.  Pay close 
attention to how traders control their brokers.   
Trustworthiness and creditworthiness.  People are trustworthy if they try to do what they say 
they will do.  People are creditworthy if they can do what they say they will do.  Since people 
often will not or cannot do what they promise, market institutions must be designed to effectively 
and inexpensively enforce contracts.  Pay close attention to the mechanisms that ensure that 
traders will settle their trades.  Attempts to solve trustworthiness and creditworthiness problems 
explain much of the structure of market institutions. 
The zero-sum game.  All trades involve two or more parties.  The accounting gains made by 
one side must equal the accounting losses suffered by the other side.  Understanding the origins 
of trading profits therefore requires that we understand both sides of a trade.  We must 
understand why traders on one side expect to profit, and why traders on other side either are 
willing to lose or do not understand that they should expect to lose. 
1.6 Outline of the Book 
The book is organized into seven parts.  Part I examines the structure of trading.  Several 
chapters describe how markets are organized and regulated, and how traders trade in them.  
Although much of the information is descriptive, the text also analyzes how various market 
structures affect trading strategies.   
Part II considers what benefits markets produce for traders and for the wider economy.  We must 
address these questions to judge whether the markets are working well.  The first of the two 
chapters in this part of the book considers why people trade.  The other chapter explains how 
markets benefit the whole economy.  This chapter concludes with my opinion about what 
markets should do and for whom.  Your opinion may differ from mine. 
To understand how trading rules affect traders, you must first understand how traders behave.  
The book therefore next devotes many chapters to understanding what various traders do.  These 
chapters should be especially interesting to readers who want to become traders and to traders 
who want to improve their trading skills.  Part III includes chapters that consider various 
speculative trading strategies.  Part IV examines the traders who offer liquidity. 
Part V contains two chapters that will help you to better understand the origins of liquidity and 
volatility.  Both concepts are described in relation to the various trading strategies introduced in 
Parts III and IV.   
We consider the problems of evaluating trader performance in Part VI.  You must understand 
these issues if you intend to manage brokers, or if you want to know why index markets are so 
popular.  These chapters lay the foundation for understanding who profits, and who loses, from 
trading.  If you intend to trade for profit or invest your money with a money manager, the chapter 
on performance evaluation and prediction will be of great interest to you. 
Finally, Part VII concludes with several chapters that consider the economics of various market 
structures.  These chapters examine how markets are organized, how they compete with each 
other, and how they respond to extreme volatility.  These chapters will obviously interest

regulators and exchange officials.  They should also interest farsighted traders:  Being able to 
predict how changes in rules, technologies, and competitive relationships affects markets 
distinguishes winning traders from losers.  
Numerous text boxes appear throughout the book.  These boxes contain examples, stories, and 
historical explanations that illustrate and illuminate points made in the text.  They are useful as 
mnemonic devices for remembering jargon and concepts.  I beg your indulgence for the puns, 
wordplays, lighthearted jabs, and unsolicited opinions that appear in them.  
Bulls and Bears 
Traders call rising markets bull markets and falling markets bear markets.  According to legend, 
these terms originated from morbid contests that promoters once staged between bulls and bears.  
Bulls fight by thrusting upward with their horns.  In contrast, bears fight by striking downward 
with their claws.  This image has generated a small cottage industry of artisans who create bull-
fighting-bear sculptures that traders buy to adorn their offices and living rooms.  
 
I took the examples that appear throughout the book from all types of markets and from many 
different countries.  A disproportionate number, however, involve equity trading in the United 
States since these are the best-known markets in the world.  As noted above, most principles that 
apply to these markets also apply to all other markets.  
1.7 An Important Disclaimer 
Traders often encounter significant legal and tax issues.  Some types of trades are illegal, many 
trades create significant tax liabilities, and many commercial relationships in trading create 
important legal liabilities.  If you trade, you must know the legal consequences of your actions.   
The purpose of this book is to examine economic issues in trading, not legal issues.  The text 
addresses many legal issues because legal issues often have significant economic implications 
for the markets, and because economic issues often are the basis for legal regulation.  This book 
will help you to better understand the economic implications of laws that regulate securities, 
contracts, traders, and exchanges.  It will also help you understand the economic bases for many 
regulations.  It is not an authority for what the law is nor for what laws you should pay attention 
to.   
Do not rely upon this book for guidance on any legal issues.  Your author is not a qualified legal 
advisor.  Consult a qualified attorney when you must address legal questions.  
1.8 Summary 
This book will help you understand the theory and practice of trading in exchange markets and 
dealer networks.  When you master this subject, you will be able to trade more effectively, you 
will better appreciate the organization of our markets, and you will be able to form well-reasoned 
opinions about how the markets should be organized.   
Markets have changed substantially during the last 100 years, and they will continue to change in 
the next 100 years.  The current pace of change is fast and accelerating.  By the time you read 
this, some specific descriptive information in this book will undoubtedly be dated.  The

economic principles governing markets and the traders in them, however, will remain the same.  
These concepts will help you understand all markets—past, present, and future.

Chapter 2 
Trading Stories 
This chapter presents stories about how traders arrange routine trades in stocks, bonds, futures 
contracts, and currencies.  If you are new to trading, you should read this chapter to help you 
appreciate the trading problems that people solve.  If you are already quite familiar with trading, 
you also may want to read this chapter.  Although these stories describe routine trades, they 
highlight difficult issues that traders confront when trading.  
This chapter is full of institutional details.  Do not worry if you do not understand every detail on 
your first reading.  After you have finished reading this book, you will be able to understand 
these stories completely.  For now, just read them to get a feel for what trading is about.  The 
impressions that you form will help you appreciate the practical importance of the analyses that 
this book presents. 
2.1 A Retail Trade in a NYSE-listed Stock 
Jennifer wants to buy 200 shares of AT&T.  She calls her retail broker with whom she has 
already established an account.  (Jennifer could also have used her broker’s Internet-based order 
entry system.)  Jennifer’s broker might work for a full service broker/dealer, such as Merrill 
Lynch, a national discount brokerage, such as Charles Schwab, or perhaps a local deep discount 
brokerage, such as Los Angeles-based Dreyfus Brokerage Services.   
Jennifer provides the broker with her account number and identifies herself.  She then asks for 
the current quotes for AT&T common stock.  The broker looks at a screen on his desk that 
appears like the Bridge Information Systems quotation display in Figure 2-1.  The screen shows 
the best bids and offers for AT&T that traders display in the Consolidated Quotation System.  
The quotes come from dealers at the New York Stock Exchange, from dealers at several regional 
exchanges, from some independent NASD (National Association of Securities Dealers) dealers, 
and from some electronic communications networks (ECNs) that display limit orders that their 
clients have placed with them.  The broker responds by quoting the best current prices at which 
traders can immediately buy or sell AT&T (ticker symbol “T”) shares.  Given the information in 
Figure 2-1, the broker reports that the best (highest) bid for AT&T is for 19.83 dollars and the 
best (lowest) offer is at 19.85.  The broker also tells Jennifer that the last trade in AT&T was at 
19.84 dollars, which is down 0.10 from the previous day’s close.  Jennifer considers the quote.  
She then gives her broker instructions to buy the shares.

Figure 2-1.  A Quotation Montage for NYSE-listed AT&T Common Stock 
Source: Bridge Information Systems 
The first line shows that this quotation montage provided by Bridge Information Systems is for US ticker symbol T, which corresponds 
to AT&T Corp common stock.  The plus at the beginning of the second line shows that this price is higher than the last different trade 
price.  AT&T last traded at 19.84, down 0.10 from the previous day’s closing price.  The trade took place at the NYSE (N) at 14:06 
Eastern Time (2:06 PM).  The highest price of the day so far was 20 and the lowest was 19.51.  The total trading volume so far was 
8,341,400 shares.  
The table that follows consists of a two sets of four columns each for bid and ask quotes.  The first column of each set identifies the 
quote maker.  Exchanges have one and three letter symbols.  Dealer-brokers and electronic communications networks have four letter 
symbols.  The exchanges listed here are the New York (N and NYD), Boston (B), Pacific (P), Cincinnati (C), Philadelphia (X), and 
Chicago (M) Stock Exchanges.  The symbol (T) refers to the best quote from an NASD over-the-counter dealer.  The next three columns 
show the time when the quote was made, the price, and the number of shares (in hundred lots) for which it is firm.  The dealer-brokers 
that appear on this list are Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, Inc. (MADF), Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. (SBSH), Southwest 
Securities, Inc. (SWST), and Trimark Securities, Inc. (TRIM).  The electronic communications networks are Archipelago (ARCA) and 
the Nasdaq Computer Assisted Execution System (CAES).   
The rows on the bid side are sorted so that the bids with the highest prices are at the top.  Bids that have the same price are sorted so that 
bids with larger sizes are above bids with smaller sizes.  Bids that have the same price and size are sorted so that bids made earlier appear 
above bids made later.  The rows on the ask side are sorted so that the asks with the lowest prices are at the top.  Otherwise, the sort order 
is the same as that for the bids. 
The first line on the bid side shows that the NYSE specialist indicated that at 14:06, buyers there indicated that they were willing to buy 
at least a total of 600 shares for 19.83.  This interest may come from traders on the floor of the exchange, from the specialist’s limit order 
book, or from the specialist himself.  The plus sign next to the time indicates that this bid was higher than the last different bid price.  
The “dq” next to the NYSE bid size indicates that the NYSE has also distributed a depth quote.  The symbol NYD identifies the NYSE 
depth quotes.  Traders at the NYSE are willing to buy at least 50,000 shares for 19.50.   
The NYSE ask quote is not the lowest price ask in the market.  The Madoff offer for 5,000 shares and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange 
offer for 100 shares are one penny lower.  The Madoff offer generated the lines that start with T and CAES. 
The two rows near the bottom of the screen present order indications (OI) that brokers and dealers have asked Bridge to display to 
Bridge clients.  The first order indication on the buy side is from Lehman Brothers, Inc. (LEHM).  The first indication on the sell side is 
from Prudential Securities, Inc. (PRUS).   
The first item on the last line of this screen shows the command that requested this display.  (Sometimes this line also shows the 
command that Bridge expects you will next want to enter.)  The first part of the command, “T,” indicates the ticker symbol.  The next 
part “/q” requests Bridge’s quote montage.  The Bridge server filled this request on October 4, 2001 at 14:06 New York City time.

To convey her intentions, Jennifer will use either a market order or a limit order.  A market order 
instructs the broker to buy at the best price available.  A limit order instructs the broker to buy at 
the best price possible, but in no event pay more than a limit price that Jennifer specifies.  If 
Jennifer uses a limit order, she will also specify when she wants the order to expire.  For 
example, a day order will expire when the trading session ends. 
Jennifer decides to submit a day limit order to buy 200 shares of AT&T, ticker symbol “T,” for 
no more than 19.80 dollars per share.  The broker enters Jennifer’s order into his computerized 
order entry system.  The system then confirms that Jennifer is authorized to make the trade.  
Next, the broker reads back the order to ensure that it is exactly what Jennifer intended.  (The 
brokerage firm records the telephone calls in case a dispute arises about what they said.)  After 
Jennifer confirms the order, the broker releases it, and the order entry system sends it to an 
exchange or to a dealer.  
Although AT&T primarily trades at the New York Stock Exchange, Jennifer’s brokerage house 
might not send her order there.  As Figure 2-1 demonstrates, many other exchanges and dealers 
also trade AT&T.  The brokerage might send the order to a regional exchange or to a NASD 
dealer.  Where the brokerage order system sends the order may depend on the prices the various 
markets quote.  It may also depend on cash payments and other nonmonetary inducements that 
dealers offer brokerages to obtain their order flow.   
The brokerage’s order entry system sends Jennifer’s order to the NYSE by transferring it to the 
NYSE’s SuperDot order routing system.  SuperDot then presents the order to the specialist who 
manages AT&T trading on the floor of the exchange.  The specialist will act as the floor broker 
for Jennifer’s order.  Jennifer’s order appears on a workstation screen that the specialist rents 
from the exchange.   
The AT&T specialist is a trader who works for a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange.  
He sometimes trades as a dealer for his firm’s account and sometimes as a broker for his clients.  
The Exchange gives the specialist some special privileges and special responsibilities.  The 
specialist receives all of the SuperDot order flow in AT&T.  He organizes the AT&T trading to 
ensure that it is orderly, and he represents all orders entrusted to him.  In exchange, the Exchange 
requires that he trade for his own account to fill customer market orders if no one else is willing 
to do so. 
Since Jennifer’s order is a limit order, the specialist first sees if anyone is interested in filling it 
immediately.  No sellers are presently interested because other traders are bidding higher prices.  
The specialist then places her order in his electronic limit order book.  Jennifer’s order will stand 
in the book until the specialist can match it with someone who wants to sell at or below its limit 
price, until the order expires, or until Jennifer tells her broker to cancel it.  
(If Jennifer submitted a market order instead of a limit order, the specialist would conduct an 
auction to find the trader willing to sell at the lowest price.  A trader on the floor, a standing limit 
order in the order book, or the specialist himself might offer that price.  If no one wants to fill the 
market order, the specialist would fill it himself by selling some of his own shares in AT&T to 
Jennifer.)   
A few minutes after Jennifer entered her order, a large seller sends a market order through 
SuperDot.  The specialist uses his computer to match this order with several orders including

Part I 
The Structure of Trading 
 
The chapters in this part of this book describe how traders arrange their trades.  We start in 
Chapter 3 with a quick introduction to the trading industry.  This chapter provides you with some 
background information about who trades, what they trade, where they trade, and how their 
trading is regulated.  You can safely skip reading this chapter if you are already familiar with the 
industry.  
Chapter 4 describes how traders communicate their orders to the brokers, dealers, and exchanges 
that arrange their traders.  We describe the orders that traders use and examine the properties of 
those orders.  We also establish important concepts about the origins of liquidity in this chapter.  
In Chapter 5, we consider how market structures vary.  The differences in how markets organize 
their trading are important because they affect the profitability of different types of traders.  We 
start to consider the relative advantages of various trading systems in this chapter.  
Chapter 6 describes how exchanges use order-driven market mechanisms to arrange trades.  The 
discussion introduces important issues that affect how traders formulate optimal order 
submission strategies. 
Chapter 7 discusses how brokers serve their clients.  We carefully describe their roles as trade 
negotiators and as clearing and settlement agents.  You may find this chapter most interesting for 
its discussions about how markets prevent traders from engaging in various types of fraudulent 
activities.

Chapter 3 
The Trading Industry 
This chapter provides a brief survey of the trading industry.  If you are already familiar with the 
industry, you can safely skip this chapter.  If you are new to trading, the discussions here will 
provide you with the “big picture” that will allow you to better understand the rest of this book.  
In particular, you will be better able to discriminate between issues of primary and secondary 
importance if you know the context in which traders solve their trading problems.   
This chapter is full of financial jargon and institutional detail.  Most of it is not necessary for 
understanding the remainder of this book.  If you are interested only in understanding market 
structure, you need not master the details.   
We first consider who trades.  Then we characterize trading instruments and the markets where 
they trade.  Finally, we examine how regulators oversee trading.   
3.1 Who Are the Players? 
Traders are people who trade.  They may arrange their own trades, they may have others arrange 
trades for them, or they may arrange trades for others.  Proprietary traders trade for their own 
accounts while brokers arrange trades as agents for their clients.  Brokers are also called agency 
traders, commission traders, or commission merchants.  Proprietary traders engage in 
proprietary trading, and brokers engage in agency trading.  
Traders have long positions when they own something.  Traders with long positions profit when 
prices rise.  They try to buy low and sell high.   
Traders have short positions when they have sold something that they do not own.  Traders with 
short positions hope that prices will fall so that they can repurchase at a lower price.  When they 
repurchase, they cover their positions.  Short sellers profit when they sell high and buy low.   
The trading industry has a buy side and a sell side.  The buy side consists of traders who buy 
exchange services.  Liquidity is the most important of these services.  Liquidity is the ability to 
trade when you want to trade.  Traders on the sell side sell liquidity to the buy side.  A 
substantial fraction of this book considers how interactions between buy side and sell side traders 
determine the price of liquidity.   
(The buy- and sell sides of the trading industry have nothing to do with whether a trader is a 
buyer or seller of an instrument.  Traders on both sides of the trading industry regularly buy and 
sell securities and contracts.  The terms buy side and sell side refer to buyers and sellers of 
exchange services.)  
3.1.1 The Buy Side 
The buy side of the trading industry includes individuals, funds, firms, and governments that use 
the markets to help solve various problems that they face.  These problems typically originate 
outside of trading markets.  For example, investors use securities markets to solve intertemporal 
cash flow problems:  They have income today that they would like to have available in the 
future.  They use the markets to buy stocks and bonds to move their income from the present to

the future.  We discuss this problem and other buy side trading problems in Chapter 8 (Why 
People Trade). 
Many buy side institutions are pension funds, mutual funds, trusts, endowments, and foundations 
that invest money.  These institutions are known collectively as investment sponsors.  Investment 
sponsors frequently employ investment advisors to manage their funds.  Investment advisors are 
also called investment counselors, investment managers, or portfolio managers.  Investment 
advisors often employ traders to implement their trading decisions.  These traders are buy side 
traders.  The people and institutions who will ultimately benefit from the funds that investment 
sponsors hold are beneficiaries.  A summary of buy side traders appears in Table 3-1.

3.1.2 The Sell Side 
The sell side of the trading industry includes dealers and brokers who provide exchange services 
to the buy side.  Both types of traders help buy side traders trade when they want to trade.   
Dealers accommodate trades that their clients want to make by trading with them when their 
clients want to trade.  Dealers profit when they buy low and sell high.  We discuss dealers in 
Chapter 13.  
In contrast, brokers trade on behalf of their clients.  Brokers arrange trades that their clients want 
to make by finding other traders who will trade with their clients.  Brokers profit when their

3-3 
clients pay them commissions for arranging trades with other traders.  We discuss brokers in 
Chapter 7. 
Many sell side firms employ traders who both deal and broker trades.  These firms therefore are 
known as broker-dealers or dual traders. 
The Wire in Wirehouse 
Traders often call large broker-dealers wirehouses.  The word “wire” in wirehouse once referred 
to the telegraph.  Following its invention, broker-dealers used the telegraph to collect orders from 
branch offices in distant cities.  Those who quickly adopted it were able to expand their 
businesses substantially and thereby greatly increase their profits.  The ability to communicate 
quickly was—and remains—very important in the trading industry. 
 
The sell side exists only because the buy side will pay for its services.  We therefore must 
understand why the buy side trades before we can understand when the sell side is profitable.  
We consider how and why both sides trade in subsequent chapters.  Table 3-2 provides a 
summary of sell side of the trading industry.

Chapter 4 
Orders and Order Properties 
Orders are trade instructions.  Orders specify what traders want to trade, whether to buy or sell, 
how much, when and how to trade, and most importantly, on what terms.  Traders issue orders 
when they cannot personally negotiate their trades.   
Orders are the fundamental building blocks of trading strategies.  To trade effectively, you must 
specify exactly what you intend.  Your order submission strategy is the most important 
determinant of your success as a trader.  The proper order used at the right time can make the 
difference between a good trade, a costly trade, or no trade at all.  
Many markets arrange all their trades by using a set of rules to match buy and sell orders that 
traders submit to them.  To understand how these markets work and to use them effectively, you 
must understand how traders specify their orders.   
Understanding orders will also allow you to see where liquidity comes from.  Liquidity is the 
ability to trade when you want to trade.  Some orders offer liquidity by presenting other traders 
with trading opportunities.  Other orders take liquidity by seizing those opportunities.  Trader 
decisions to offer or take liquidity therefore affect market quality.  To understand liquidity, you 
must understand how traders form their order submission strategies. 
This chapter will show you what orders are, how traders specify them, and most importantly, 
what properties they have.  Traders choose orders that have properties that allow them to best 
solve their trading problems. 
Familiarize yourself with the many trading terms introduced in this chapter.  We will use them 
throughout the book.  Traders use specialized words and phrases to communicate quickly and 
accurately with each other.  Whether you intend to trade or simply want to learn about trading, 
you need to be familiar with market nomenclature.   
Although order instructions have the same meanings in all markets, their properties differ 
depending on the type of market to which traders submit them.  In this chapter, we will assume 
that traders submit their orders to a continuous trading market that arranges trades as orders 
arrive.  Identical orders have slightly different properties in call markets that collect and process 
all orders at the same time.  We examine call markets and the properties of orders submitted to 
them in Chapter 6 (Order-driven Markets).   
4.1 What Are Orders, and Why Do People Use Them?  
Orders are instructions that traders give to the brokers and exchanges that arrange their trades.  
The instructions explain how they want their trades to be arranged.   
An order always specifies which instrument (or instruments) to trade, how much to trade, and 
whether to buy or sell.  An order may also include conditions that a trade must satisfy.  The most 
common conditions limit the prices that the trader will accept.  Other conditions may specify for 
how long the order is valid, when the order can be executed, whether it is okay to partially fill 
the order, where to present the order, and how to search for the other side.  Some orders even 
specify the traders with whom the trader is willing to trade.

An Order Example 
Harry wants to sell 7,600 shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) at no less than 41.05 dollars per share, 
but only if he can trade during the current trading session and only if he can trade the entire 
quantity at once.  He would issue an all-or-nothing, day order to sell 7,600 shares of XON, limit 
41.05 dollars.   
 
Orders are necessary because most traders do not personally arrange their trades.  Traders who 
arrange their own trades—typically dealers—do not use orders.  They decide on the spot what 
they want to do and how to do it.  All other traders must carefully express their intentions ahead 
of time. 
For many small traders, it is not economical to continuously monitor the market.  These traders 
use orders to represent their interests when they are not paying close attention to the market.   
Traders who arrange their own trades have an advantage over traders who use orders to express 
their intentions.  The former can respond to market conditions as they change.  The latter must 
anticipate such changes and write contingencies into their orders to deal with them.  Carefully 
written orders will adequately represent traders’ interests even when conditions change.  When 
orders do not do so, traders must cancel them and resubmit new instructions.  During the time it 
takes to cancel and resubmit orders, traders can lose because their old orders trade before they 
can cancel them, or because they cannot submit new orders in time to take advantage of the 
changing market conditions.  Traders therefore must carefully specify their intentions when they 
use orders to trade.   
In general, traders who can respond most quickly to changes in market conditions have an 
advantage over slower traders.  Traders who submit and cancel orders manually are slower than 
traders who use computers to monitor and adjust their orders.  Where speed is of the essence, 
floor traders and computerized traders are the most successful traders.   
Clear and efficient communication is essential when trading in fast markets.  Brokers must 
understand exactly what traders intend.  Otherwise, extremely costly errors may occur.  To avoid 
mistakes, most traders use standard orders to decrease the probability that they will 
misunderstand each other when communicating quickly.  All traders recognize and understand 
these orders.   
This chapter introduces the standard orders and describes their properties.  We must define some 
basic terms first. 
4.2 Some Important Terms 
Traders indicate that they are willing to buy or sell by making bids and offers.  Traders quote 
their bids and offers when they arrange their own trades.  Otherwise, they use orders to convey 
their bids and offers to the brokers or automated trading systems that arrange their trades.  Bids 
and offers usually include information about the prices and quantities that traders will accept.  
Traders call these prices bid and offer prices.  They also use the terms bidding price, offering 
price, asking price, or simply bid and ask.  They refer to the quantities as sizes. 
Prices are firm when traders can demand to trade at those prices.  Prices are soft if the traders 
who offer them can revise them before trading.  Orders generally have firm prices.

The highest bid price in a market is the best bid.  The lowest offer price is the best offer (or 
equivalently, the best ask).  Traders also call them the market bid and the market offer (or market 
ask) because they are the best prices available in the market.  A market quotation reports the best 
bid and best offer in a market.  A market quotation is often called the BBO, which is the acronym 
for Best Bid and Offer.  Many markets continuously publicize their market quotations.  The best 
bid and offer anywhere in the United States is the NBBO—National Best Bid and Offer.   
The difference between the best ask and the best bid is the bid/ask spread.  Traders sometimes 
call it the inside spread because the space between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price 
is inside the market.  The English often refer to the spread as the touch.  In sports betting 
markets, bettors and bookies call it the vigorish. 
An order offers liquidity—or equivalently supplies liquidity—if it gives other traders an 
opportunity to trade.  For example, suppose Joe issues an order to buy 100 shares of IBM for no 
more than 100 dollars per share from the first person to contact him before trading closes today.  
Joe’s bid offers liquidity because other traders now have the opportunity to sell IBM for 100 
dollars per share.  Joe’s bid is a day limit order because it is only valid for the day, and because 
Joe limits the price that he will pay. 
Buyers and sellers can both offer liquidity.  Buyers offer liquidity when their bids give other 
traders opportunities to sell.  Sellers offer liquidity when their offers give other traders 
opportunities to buy.   
The dual use of the word “offer” may seem confusing.  It may refer to an offer of an item for 
sale, or to an offer of liquidity.  If you think of liquidity—the ability to trade when you want to 
trade—as a service that you can buy or sell, the use of the word “offer” makes sense.  This 
perspective leads to many useful insights.  For example, dealers make money by selling liquidity 
to their clients. 
Standing orders are open offers to trade.  Joe’s order will stand until someone sells to Joe at 100 
dollars or less, the order expires at the end of the day, or Joe cancels it.  Standing orders are also 
called open orders.  Since standing orders allow other traders to trade when they want to trade, 
traders offer liquidity when they have orders outstanding. 
Traders who want to trade quickly demand liquidity.  Traders take liquidity when they accept 
offers—standing limit orders or quotes—that other traders made.  If Sue is willing to sell 100 
shares of IBM at 100 dollars, she can initiate a trade by taking Joe’s offer.   
Traders who demand to trade immediately demand immediacy.  We show in Chapter 19 
(Liquidity) that immediacy is one of several dimensions of liquidity.   
A market is liquid when traders can trade without significant adverse effect on price.  Markets 
with many standing limit orders and small bid/ask spreads are usually quite liquid. 
The prices at which orders fill are trade prices.  Buy orders that trade at high prices and sell 
orders that trade at low prices trade at inferior prices.   
Markets and traders sometimes treat orders differently depending on whether they are agency 
orders or proprietary orders.  Agency orders are orders that brokers represent as agents for their 
clients.  Proprietary orders are orders that traders represent for their own accounts.  In many 
organized markets, agency orders have precedence over proprietary orders at the same price.

Chapter 5 
Market Structures 
The trading rules and the trading systems used by a market define its market structure.  They 
determine who can trade; what they can trade; and when, where, and how they can trade.  They 
also determine what information traders can see about orders, quotations, and trades; when they 
can see it; and who can see it.   
Market structure is extremely important because it determines what people can know and do in a 
market.  Since power comes from knowledge and the ability to act on it, market structure helps 
determine power relations among various types of traders.  These relationships greatly affect 
who will trade profitably.  
To trade effectively, you need to know the structure of every market in which you trade.  The 
trading strategies that are successful in one market often do not work well in markets with 
different structures.  The best order submission strategy for a given trading problem generally 
depends on the structure of the market where the trader intends to solve the problem.  Traders 
therefore behave differently in different markets. 
You must understand market structure, and how it affects trader behavior, to understand the 
origins of market liquidity, price efficiency, volatility, and trading profits.  These variables all 
depend on trader behavior.  Since market structure affects trader behavior, it helps determine 
whether markets will be liquid, whether prices will be informative, and which traders will trade 
profitably.  
We will introduce and describe a framework for classifying market structures.  This 
classification scheme will help you recognize how markets are similar and dissimilar to each 
other.  Being able to classify market structures will be useful to you since trading problems have 
similar solutions in similar markets.  If you understand how to trade in one market, you should 
be able to apply your knowledge and experience to other similar markets.  We will use this 
classification system throughout the rest of this book.   
We will start by discussing the different types of trading sessions that exchanges, brokerages, 
and dealers organize.  We then will discuss the various execution systems that traders use to 
arrange their trades.  Finally, we will describe the information processing systems that transmit 
orders into and out of markets, present market information to traders and to the public, and store 
open orders. 
5.1 Overview 
Trading takes place in trading sessions.  The two types of trading sessions are continuous trading 
sessions and call market sessions.  In continuous trading, traders can attempt to arrange their 
trades whenever the market is open.  In call markets, all trades take place only when the market 
is called. 
Trading forums are the places where traders arrange their trades.  In physically convened 
markets, traders must be on a trading floor to negotiate their trades.  Physically convened futures 
markets trade in trading pits.  Physically convened stock markets trade at posts.  In distributed

5-2 
access markets, traders use telephones or screen-based trading systems to arrange their trades 
from their offices.  
Physically Convened Screen-based Markets 
Although screen-based trading systems are ideally suited for distributed access markets, many 
Asian exchanges with screen-based trading systems once required their traders to be on their 
trading floors to use their electronic systems.  This arrangement made it easier for exchanges to 
regulate their traders.  It also allowed them to construct reliable communications networks, 
which was once an important issue in countries with poor telecommunications infrastructures.   
Many traders like to trade in physically convened markets because they enjoy the society of 
other traders.  Now that exchange regulations no longer require them to be there, many traders 
have stayed on the exchange floor.  
 
Some countries require that traders arrange all trades in a given instrument at a particular 
exchange.  For example, with few exceptions, it is illegal to arrange trades in a Chicago Board of 
Trade corn futures contract outside of the corn futures trading pit on the CBOT floor.  These 
restrictions are common in many futures markets and in the equities markets of some Asian and 
Eastern European countries.  
Traders and exchanges use various execution systems to arrange trades.  In quote-driven systems, 
dealers arrange most trades when they trade with their customers.  In order-driven systems, all 
trades are arranged by using order precedence rules to match buyers to sellers and trade pricing 
rules to determine the prices of the resulting trades.  In brokered trading systems, brokers 
arrange trades by helping buyers and sellers find each other. 
Various information systems move information in and out of the market, present it, and store it.  
Order routing systems send orders from customers to brokers, from brokers to dealers, from 
brokers to markets, and from markets to markets.  These systems also send reports of filled 
orders back to customers.  Order presentation systems present orders to traders so that they can 
act upon them.  The systems may use screen-based, open-outcry, or hand-signaling technologies.  
Order books store open orders.  Market data systems report trades and quotes to the public. 
In most markets, traders can only use prices that are an integer multiple of a specified minimum 
price increment.  The size of the increment, measured as a fraction of price, varies considerably 
across markets.  In Chapter 11 (Order Anticipators), we show that the increment is an extremely 
important determinant of market quality in many markets.  
Price Clustering 
Traders do not use all possible prices equally.  Instead, their usage clusters on round numbers.  In 
markets with fractional prices, they use whole numbers more often than halves, halves more 
often than odd quarters, quarters more often than odd eighths, and eighths more often than odd 
sixteenths.  In markets with decimal prices, prices that are integer multiples of 1.00, 0.50, 0.25, 
0.20, 0.10, and 0.05 are likewise most common.  The clustering of prices is most pronounced 
when the minimum price increment is a small fraction of price, the market is highly volatile, and 
the instrument is thinly traded.

Clever traders often consider the clustering of limit order prices when they place limit orders.  
They frequently place their orders just above or just below a round number to take advantage of 
the fact that many other traders may place their prices at the round number.  
 
5.2 Trading Sessions 
Markets have trading sessions during which trades are arranged.  The two types of trading 
sessions are continuous market sessions and call market sessions.  
5.2.1 Continuous Markets 
In continuous markets, traders may trade anytime while the market is open.  Trading is 
continuous in the sense that traders may continuously attempt to arrange their trades.  In practice, 
they usually trade only when a trader demands liquidity.   
Continuous trading markets are very common.  Almost all major stock, bond, futures, options, 
and foreign exchange markets have continuous trading sessions.  
5.2.2 Call Markets 
In call markets, all traders trade at the same time when the market is called.  The market may call 
all securities simultaneously, or it may call the securities one at a time, in a rotation.  Markets 
that call in rotation may complete only one rotation per trading session, or as many rotations as 
their trading hours permit.  Markets that call in rotation were once very common.  Now only in 
the stock markets of a few small countries call in rotation.   
Many continuous order-driven exchanges open their trading sessions with call market auctions 
and then switch over to continuous trading.  These markets also use calls to restart their trading 
after a trading halt.  Open-outcry futures exchanges, however, start continuous trading 
immediately when they open. 
Call markets are used as the exclusive market mechanism for many instruments.  Most 
governments sell their bonds, notes, and bills in call market auctions.  Some stock markets also 
use calls to trade their least active securities.  The Deutsche Börse and Euronext Paris Bourse are 
examples of such markets.  
Call Market Betting at the Horse Races 
US horse racetracks offer pari-mutuel betting to their betting clients.  In pari-mutuel betting, 
bettors receive a share of the total money bet on all horses—less a fixed percentage for the track 
and the state—if their horse wins.  Bettors can place their bets anytime until betting closes a few 
moments after the start of the race.  The track totalizator system displays the projected winnings 
for each bet while the betters place their bets.   
Pari-mutuel betting is a call market auction in which the totalizator simultaneously prices all bets 
on a race.  (The price of each bet is the amount bettors must bet to receive a dollar if their horse 
wins.)  The call occurs when betting closes.  Since the system only allows market orders, many 
traders wait until the last moment to bet so that they can see what the prices will be.

Chapter 6 
Order-driven Markets 
Order-driven markets use trading rules to arrange their trades.  These markets include oral 
auctions, single price auctions, continuous electronic auctions, and crossing networks.  You will 
learn how these markets work, and how trading strategies depend on market structure. 
Order-driven markets are quite common.  Almost all of the most important exchanges in the 
world are order-driven markets.  Most newly organized trading systems choose electronic order-
driven market structures. 
Despite the great variation in how order-driven markets operate, their trading rules are all quite 
similar.  All order-driven markets use order precedence rules to match buyers to sellers and 
trade pricing rules to price the resulting trades. 
Variations in trading rules distinguish order-driven markets from each other.  The trading 
strategies that work best in one market may work poorly in markets with different rules.  Traders 
therefore need to know how trading rules affect optimal trading strategies.   
If you trade in order-driven markets, the principles introduced in this chapter will be of 
immediate and obvious value to you.  These principles will also help you understand front-
running and block trading strategies that we will consider in later chapters. 
The topics in this chapter should also interest you if you are interested in market structures.  
Most recent innovations in trading technologies involve order-driven market structures.  To 
evaluate new trading technologies, you must thoroughly understand how they work. 
We will first discuss how oral auctions work.  In these order-driven markets, traders arrange 
trades by negotiating on a trading floor.  Since many readers may already be acquainted with 
these markets, they provide us with a familiar context for introducing various trading rules.  We 
then will turn our attention to rule-based order-matching systems.  These systems include single 
price auctions, continuous order book auctions, and crossing networks. 
6.1 Oral Auctions 
Many futures, options, and stock exchanges use continuous bilateral oral auctions to trade their 
contracts and securities.  The largest oral auction market is the US Government Long Treasury 
Bond futures market.  This market, which the Chicago Board of Trade organizes, regularly 
attracts 500 floor traders.  It may be the most liquid market in the world.  The smallest oral 
auctions may include only two traders. 
In an oral auction, traders arrange their trades face-to-face on an exchange trading floor.  Some 
traders cry out their bids and offers to attract other traders.  Other traders listen for bids and 
offers that they are willing to accept.  Most traders do both.  Trades occur when a buyer accepts a 
seller’s offer, or when a seller accepts a buyer’s bid.  In the former case, the buyer will call out 
“take it” to accept the offer.  In the latter case, the seller will call out “sold” to accept the bid.  
Buyers and sellers often take turns bidding and offering until they agree on a price and quantity 
to trade.  Traders offer liquidity when they make bids or offers to trade.  Traders take liquidity 
when they accept bids or offers.

The traders must obey the market trading rules.  These rules organize trading to ensure fairness 
for all traders and to provide for the efficient exchange of information necessary to arrange 
trades.  The trading rules also help protect brokerage customers from dishonest brokers.  
The first rule of an oral auction is the open-outcry rule.  Traders must publicly express all bids 
and offers so that all traders can act on them.  This requirement ensures that all traders can fairly 
participate in the market.  In most oral auctions, any trader can accept another trader’s bid or 
offer, even if they are not actively negotiating with that trader.  The first trader to accept a bid or 
offer generally gets to trade.  The open-outcry rule also requires traders to express their 
acceptances publicly so that all traders are aware of the trades that they arrange.  This 
information helps traders evaluate market conditions.  It also protects customers from dishonest 
brokers who might try to arrange trades privately to benefit their friends instead of their clients.   
6.1.1 Order Precedence Rules 
The order precedence rules of an oral auction determine who can bid or offer, and whose bids 
and offers traders can accept.  In oral auctions, the primary order precedence rule is always price 
priority.  The secondary precedence rules depend on the market.  Futures markets use time 
precedence.  US stock exchanges use public order precedence and then time precedence.   
6.1.1.1 Price priority 
The price priority rule gives precedence to the traders who bid and offer the best prices.  Traders 
cannot accept bids or offers at any inferior price.  Buyers can accept only the lowest priced offers 
and sellers can accept only the highest priced bids.   
Price priority is a self-enforcing rule because honest traders naturally search for the best prices.  
Exchanges therefore do not have to adopt special procedures to enforce it.  They keep the rule on 
their books so that they can prosecute dishonest brokers.   
Most oral auctions do not allow traders to bid below the best bid or offer above the best offer.  
Since only the best bid and offer interest traders, bids and offers behind the market only create 
confusion and noise. 
Traders acquire price priority by bidding or offering prices that improve the current best bid or 
offer.  Any trader may improve the best bid or offer at any time.   
6.1.1.2 Time Precedence 
The time precedence rule used in most oral auctions gives precedence to the traders whose bid or 
offer first improves the current best bid or offer.  While they have time precedence, no other 
traders may bid or offer at the new best bid or offer. 
Traders retain their time precedence as long as they maintain their bid or offer, or until another 
trader accepts it.  Afterwards, anyone may bid or offer at the new price and all traders at that 
price will have equal standing.   
In oral auction markets, bids and offers generally are good only for a moment.  Traders say, “A 
quote is good only as long as the breath is warm.”  In practice, traders who do not honor their 
quotes for a reasonable period find that nobody wants to trade with them.  Traders maintain their

6-3 
precedence by repeating their quotes as often as is necessary to show that they remain interested 
in trading.  Traders may repeat their quotes continuously in large, very active markets.  
The time precedence rule encourages traders to improve prices aggressively.  Traders who want 
to trade ahead of a trader who has time precedence must improve the price.  Time precedence 
rewards aggressive traders by giving them the exclusive right to trade first at the improved price.  
The time precedence rule thus encourages price competition among traders.   
Leapfrog 
The orange juice concentrate futures market is currently 103.10 cents bid, offered at 103.25 
cents.  (Traders quote prices per pound for 15,000 pound contracts.)  Guy is the bidder at 103.10.  
He has time precedence at that price, and he is defending it.  If you want to buy at 103.10, you 
must wait until Guy trades.  If you want precedence, you must improve the bid to 103.15.  You 
then would have price priority over his bid and time precedence over all subsequent bids at 
103.15.  If Guy then wants to reclaim his precedence, he would have to improve the market again 
by bidding 103.20.  Time precedence encourages traders to play leapfrog by jumping over each 
other’s prices with improved prices.   
Good traders carefully consider their leapfrog strategies.  For example, if you are willing to bid 
103.20 and you are confident that Guy will bid 103.20 if you bid 103.15, you may want to skip 
over 103.15 and bid first at 103.20.  If you bid 103.20 and Guy still wants to trade first, he will 
take the offer at 103.25.  In which case, he will trade immediately and you will still have time 
precedence at 103.20.  Of course, if you are quite impatient to trade, your best strategy may be to 
immediately take the offer at 103.25. 
 
Time precedence is only meaningful when the minimum price increment is not trivially small.  
The minimum price increment, or tick, is the smallest amount by which a trader may improve 
prices.  It is the incremental price that traders must pay to acquire precedence, through price 
priority, when they do not have time precedence.  If it is very small, the time precedence rule 
gives little privilege to the traders who improve price. 
The effect of the tick on price competition varies by tick size.  If the tick is too small, it decreases 
price competition by weakening the time precedence rule.  If this tick is too large, traders are 
reluctant to improve prices because of the expense.  Since the minimum price increment 
significantly affects market quality, exchanges and regulators pay close attention to it. 
The Common Cents Stock Pricing Act of 1997 
In March of 1997, Republican Representative Mike Oxley and others introduced a bill to require 
that US stock markets trade on dollars and cents rather than on dollars and fractions of a dollar.  
The bill had wide popular support because most people find decimal pricing simpler to 
understand than fractional pricing.  The bill never passed.  Instead, the exchanges decided to 
switch to decimals by themselves.   
The bill was somewhat remarkable because it represented an attempt by the US Congress to 
micromanage trading rules in the stock markets.  The exchanges probably decimalized at least in 
part to prevent the passage of this bill.

Chapter 7 
Brokers 
Brokers are agents who arrange trades for their clients.  Unlike dealers, who trade with their 
clients, brokers trade their clients’ orders.  Clients usually pay brokers commissions for their 
services. 
Many brokers are also financial advisors who advise their clients about their investments or their 
financial plans.  They may also provide their clients with investment information.  In these 
capacities, they often influence the trading decisions that their clients make. 
Unless you arrange your own trades, you will use the services of a broker when you implement 
your trading strategies.  You therefore must understand what brokers can do for you—and to 
you—to trade effectively.  This chapter describes what brokers do and the problems that traders 
may have with lazy or dishonest brokers.  
You also need to know what brokers do if you want to be a broker yourself.  The discussions in 
chapter will allow you to better understand how brokers compete with each other for business, 
and how the best brokers win these competitions.  
You must understand what brokers do to predict when electronic order matching systems will be 
successful.  Automated order-driven execution systems are essentially electronic brokers.  Since 
traditional brokers and electronic order matching systems both match buyers to sellers, they 
compete with each other.  To fully understand either system, you must understand the economics 
of both trading systems.  
Finally, you must understand what brokers do if you are interested in the distinctions that 
regulators make between automated order-driven execution systems and traditional brokers.  
Some automated order-driven execution systems are regulated as exchanges whereas other 
nearly identical systems are regulated as brokers.  If you are interested in these distinctions, you 
must ask how the order matching done by traditional brokers differs from the order matching 
done by automated systems.  
We begin this chapter by considering how brokers serve their clients, how they organize their 
operations, and what determines their profits.  We then discuss how the most important 
management problem—the principal-agent problem—affects brokers and their clients.  The 
chapter closes with a discussion about problems that traders can have with dishonest brokers, and 
how traders can prevent these problems.   
7.1 What Brokers Do 
Brokers arrange trades for their clients.  They search for traders who are willing to trade with 
their clients; they represent their clients at exchanges; they arrange for dealers to fill their clients’ 
orders, they introduce their clients to electronic trading systems; and they match their clients’ 
buy and sell orders. 
Brokers conduct these activities in various types of markets.  In order flow markets, brokers take 
orders that their clients give them and match them with orders and quotes made by other traders.  
Exchanges, dealers, or the brokers themselves may operate these markets.  Brokers generally 
search for the best price only among traders who are willing to display their limit orders and

quotes in these markets.  In block markets, brokers take large client orders and try to find other 
traders to fill them.  Brokers often must search among traders who have not expressed interest in 
trading to discover those traders who are willing to trade.  In offering markets, brokers distribute 
new issues and seasoned issues to traders.  Brokers must often market these securities to generate 
buyer interest.  Finally, in merger and acquisition markets, brokers help firms buy other firms.  
Brokerage firms that engage in large capital transactions are called investment banks.  Table 7-1 
summarizes the different types of brokered transactions.

Brokered 
Brokers find one or both parties. 
 
Only the largest investment banks operate in all types of markets.  Most brokerage firms 
specialize in only one or two of these markets.  
In all markets, brokers are their clients’ agents.  Their clients tell them what trades they want to 
make, and under what terms they will trade.  The brokers then try to arrange the best trades that 
they can subject to the constraints imposed upon them.  Generally, clients expect that brokers 
will seek the lowest possible prices when buying and the highest possible prices when selling.  
Clients use brokers to arrange their trades because brokers usually can arrange trades at a much 
lower cost than can their clients.  The following reasons explain why brokers are low cost 
traders:  
• Brokers can solve clearing and settlement problems at a lower cost than their clients can. 
• Brokers can access exchanges and dealers that their clients cannot access. 
• Brokers generally know better than their clients who might be willing to trade. 
• Brokers are often better negotiators than their clients are. 
• Brokers can represent orders for their clients when their clients are unavailable to represent 
them themselves.  
We examine these points in the remainder of this section.

7.1.1 Clearing and Settlement among Traders 
The most important, but perhaps least appreciated, reason why traders use brokers to arrange 
their trades involves clearing and settlement.  Clearing and settlement problems can arise 
whenever traders do not settle their trades immediately after they negotiate them.  During the 
time between arrangement and final settlement, traders risk that their counterparts may not 
acknowledge their trades, may refuse to settle their trades, or may be financially unable to settle 
their trades.  Traders therefore are reluctant to trade with people who they do not know are 
trustworthy and creditworthy.   
Without the assistance of brokers, traders would have to check the credit of every trader with 
whom they trade.  Brokers assist traders by helping them avoid this expensive problem.   
Brokers solve clearance problems by clearing their clients’ trades.  If a client fails to 
acknowledge a trade, the broker must resolve the problem with the client.  The broker thus 
protects the trader on the other side of the trade. 
Brokers solve the settlement problem either by guaranteeing that their clients will settle their 
trades, or by staking their business reputations on whether their clients will settle their trades.  
When brokers guarantee their clients’ trades, the brokers settle trades that their clients will not.  
When the brokers simply vouch for their clients, they risk losing future business if they acquire a 
reputation for representing clients who do not settle their trades.  In both cases, brokers must 
ensure that they only represent trustworthy and creditworthy clients.  Otherwise, undesirable 
clients will impose significant costs upon them.  The credit function that brokers provide is 
especially important in order-driven markets since such markets generally arrange trades among 
total strangers. 
Multiplying Credit Checks 
When traders arrange trades that they intend to settle in the future, they must be confident that 
their counterparts can and will perform.  Traders routinely perform credit checks to determine 
whether their counterparts are creditworthy.  
In a market with no brokers, each trader must be prepared to check the credit of every other 
trader.  If exactly one million traders trade in such a market, the total number of potential credit 
relationships is 999,999,000,000, or slightly less than one quad-trillion.  In such markets, traders 
will only check the credit of traders with whom they intend to trade.  They will naturally prefer 
to arrange trades only with traders whose credit they have already checked.  
Now suppose that this market has brokers who guarantee their clients’ trades.  Three types of 
credit relationships are present in this economy: 
1. Brokers must check the credit of their clients to protect themselves.   
2. The clients must check the credit of their brokers to ensure that they can trust them.  These 
credit checks may be perfunctory if everyone knows that a broker is creditworthy.   
3. Each broker must check the credit of every other broker with whom he or she arranges 
trades.

The Benefits of Trade 
 
The two chapters in this part discuss how trading benefits individual traders and the entire 
economy.  Chapter 8 explains why traders trade.  We introduce 32 different types of traders and 
identify the benefits that they each obtain from trading.  Remarkably, traders often do not clearly 
understand why they trade.  They therefore often trade when they should not or fail to trade when 
they should.  Traders who understand why they trade will generally trade more effectively.  
In Chapter 9, we consider how well functioning markets benefit the entire economy.  The 
primary benefits come from informative prices and from market liquidity.  We explain how well 
functioning markets help market-based economies use their resources most efficiently.  We also 
consider a framework for evaluating public policy.

Chapter 8 
Why People Trade 
People trade to invest, to borrow, to exchange assets, to hedge risks, to distribute risks, to 
gamble, to speculate, and to deal.  We consider each of these objectives in this chapter and 
explain how markets help traders achieve them. 
You must understand why people trade to use markets effectively.  Markets provide many 
valuable opportunities.  To take advantage of them, you must first recognize them. 
By considering why people trade, you will better understand why you trade and whether you 
should trade.  Many traders do not fully recognize the reasons why they trade.  Consequently, 
either they pursue inappropriate trading strategies, or they trade when trading is 
counterproductive to their true interests.  The optimal trading strategy for a given trading 
problem depends on the problem.  You cannot trade well if you do not know why you want to 
trade.   
Knowing why people trade may also help you determine whether other traders understand why 
they are trading.  This skill is very important because you can usually distinguish a good money 
manager from a poor one by whether they understand well why they trade.  It is also important 
because traders who do not fully understand why they trade often trade foolishly.  If you can 
identify such traders, you may be able to profit from their foolishness. 
If you engage in any trading strategy that depends on the volume of trade, you must understand 
why people trade to interpret volumes properly.  Many factors cause people to trade.  If your 
trading strategy depends on one of these factors, you will want to examine volumes carefully.  
However, you must be careful to recognize when other factors may cause people to trade.  
Otherwise, you may misinterpret volumes and trade when you should not.  
Markets are successful only when people trade in them.  If you want to design new markets, or if 
your business depends on trading in a successful market, you must understand why—and how—
people trade.   
Trading is a zero-sum game in an important accounting sense.  In a zero-sum game, the total 
gains of the winners are exactly equal to the total losses of the losers.  Trading is a zero-sum 
game because the combined gains and losses of buyers and sellers always sum to zero.  If a 
buyer profits from a trade, the seller loses the opportunity to profit by the same amount.  
Likewise, if a buyer loses from a trade, the seller avoids an identical loss.   
Successful traders must understand the implications of the zero-sum game.  To trade profitably, 
traders must trade with people who will lose.  Profit-motivated traders therefore must understand 
why losers trade to know when they should trade.   
Finally, you must understand why people trade to form well-reasoned opinions about market 
structures.  Different structures favor different trader types.  If you intend to influence a decision 
about market structure, you should consider first how the decision affects various traders.  The 
benefits that traders obtain from markets depend on why they trade.  Regulators and other 
interested parties must therefore understand these reasons.

This chapter identifies the main reasons why people trade.  We will refer to them throughout the 
rest of the book.  Pay close attention to the distinctions between investing, speculating, and 
gambling.  When traders confuse these important concepts, they often trade poorly.  When 
regulators confuse them, they often adopt policies that hurt the markets.  Consider also why 
liquid markets benefit most traders.  When you understand why people trade, you will appreciate 
why all market participants care about liquidity.   
For expository clarity, we will associate a stylized trader with each reason for trading, and we 
will assume that that stylized trader trades only for that reason.  In practice, traders often trade 
for many reasons.  The complexity of their motives explains why many traders get confused and 
fail to fully recognize why they trade.  By considering stylized traders, we simplify our 
discussions and ultimately make it easier for you to identify the different reasons why people 
trade. 
Multiple Identities 
Many traders simultaneously invest, speculate, and gamble.  They invest when they need to 
move money from the present to the future.  They speculate when they try to use information 
about future security prospects to obtain a better return on their investments.  They gamble when 
they focus more attention on favorable outcomes than on losing outcomes.   
Their multiplicity of interests often compromises their judgment.  Investors often speculate 
without thinking about whether they would be good speculators, and speculators often gamble 
without considering whether their emotional needs have influenced their judgment. 
 
Our stylized traders are profit-motivated traders, utilitarian traders, or futile traders.  Profit-
motivated traders trade only because they rationally expect to profit from their trades.  
Speculators and dealers are profit-motivated traders.  Utilitarian traders trade because they 
expect to obtain some benefit from trading besides trading profits.  Investors, borrowers, asset 
exchangers, hedgers, and gamblers are utilitarian traders.  Futile traders believe that they are 
profit-motivated traders.  Although they expect to trade profitably, their expectations are not 
rational.  They have no advantages that would allow them to be profitable traders.  Utilitarian 
traders and futile traders lose on average to profit-motivated traders because trading is a zero-
sum game.   
Traders are either informed traders or uninformed traders.  Informed traders can form reliable 
opinions about whether instruments are fundamentally undervalued or overvalued.  The 
fundamental value of an instrument is the value that all traders would agree upon if they knew all 
available information about the instrument and if they could properly analyze this information.  
An instrument is undervalued when its market price is below its fundamental value.  It is 
overvalued when its price is above fundamental value.  Since nobody actually knows 
fundamental values, traders must estimate them.  Informed traders typically form their opinions 
from insightful analyses of publicly available information or from simple analyses of information 
that is not widely known.  Informed traders speculate on their information by buying 
undervalued instruments and selling overvalued instruments.  Informed traders are therefore 
profit-motivated traders.  Uninformed traders do not know whether instruments are 
fundamentally undervalued or overvalued.  Either they cannot form reliable opinions about 
values, or they choose not to.  Uninformed traders include utilitarian traders, futile traders, and 
some types of profit-motivated traders.

Our discussion starts with and primarily focuses on utilitarian traders.  At the end of the chapter, 
we will introduce the profit-motivated traders and the futile traders.  Detailed discussions of how 
they behave appear in subsequent chapters devoted exclusively to their various styles. 
8.1 Utilitarian Traders 
Utilitarian traders trade to obtain some benefit besides trading profits.  Investors and borrowers 
trade to move money forward or backward through time.  Asset exchangers trade to exchange 
one asset for another asset of greater value to them.  Hedgers trade to exchange risks.  Gamblers 
trade for entertainment.  Fledglings trade to learn how to trade.  Cross-subsidizers trade to 
transfer wealth to other people.  Tax-avoiders trade to minimize their taxes by exploiting tax 
loopholes.  We will consider each of these traders in turn. 
8.1.1 Investors and Borrowers 
People often need to move money from one point in time to another.  Workers need to move 
their current earnings from the present to the future to finance their retirements.  Students need to 
move their future earnings to the present to pay tuition.  Young couples need to move their future 
earnings to the present to buy houses.   
These problems are all examples of intertemporal cash flow timing problems.  People face 
intertemporal cash flow timing problems when their incomes and expenses do not always 
coincide.  When their incomes are more than their expenses, they invest money to move money 
into the future, or they repay money that they borrowed from the past.  When their incomes are 
less than their expenses, they borrow money from the future, or they liquidate investments that 
they made in the past.  People invest, borrow, liquidate, and repay to move money forward or 
backward through time. 
Corporations and governments also face intertemporal cash flow problems.  The most common 
problem that corporations face is inadequate current cash flow to pay for investments that will 
generate future revenues.  To solve this problem, they borrow money from the future by selling 
bonds or stock shares.  Governments most commonly borrow against their future tax revenues to 
finance current spending.  They may use the money to fund projects that will produce benefits in 
the future, to fund current services, or to enrich poor people, disabled people, retirees, 
immigrants, and in many cases, farmers and manufacturers.  
Although people, corporations, and governments invest and borrow to move money through 
time, in aggregate, no money actually moves through time.  Instead, for every dollar invested, 
someone must borrow a dollar.  The assets that investors use to move money from the present to 
the future therefore are the same assets that borrowers use to move money from the future to the 
present.  Traders buy assets when they want to move money to the future, or when they repay 
money that they previously moved from the present to the past.  They sell assets when they want 
to move money from the future to the present, or when they redeem money that they have moved 
from the past to the present. 
Investors use various financial and real assets to move money forward through time.  Financial 
assets include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, insurance policies, certificates of deposit, demand 
deposits, and currencies.  Real assets include real estate, machinery, commodities, precious 
metals, and going business concerns.  Those investors who cannot, or who would rather not,

Chapter 9 
Good Markets 
Market structures have changed significantly in the last few years, and many more changes are 
under consideration.  Throughout the world, people actively debate the following questions:   
• Should regulators consolidate all orders into a central limit order book? 
• Should markets use quote-driven or order-driven systems? 
• Should regulators allow internalization and preferencing?  
• Should regulators impose price limits or trading halts on trading?  
• Should trading use floor-based or screen-based systems?  
• Should dealers yield to their customers? 
• Should regulators require that markets be linked electronically?  How fast should those links 
be?  
• What trading hours should markets adopt?  
• Who should be able to see the limit order book? 
• Who owns market data? 
• What securities and contracts should regulators allow exchanges to trade? 
The markets have wrestled with these and many other issues in recent years.  They undoubtedly 
will continue to do so.  
Virtually any change in market structure will have significant economic effects on our markets.  
Trading rules, trading systems, and information protocols all affect liquidity, transaction costs, 
volatility, the quality of prices, and the distribution of trader profits.  We therefore must carefully 
consider whether proposed changes in market structure are desirable.  This chapter introduces a 
paradigm for how we should make these decisions.   
Everyone has an economic interest in how markets should be organized since everyone—
whether they trade or not—benefits from having well-functioning markets.  Not surprisingly, 
opinions about market structure vary widely.   
Many people try to influence market structure: 
• Legislators pass laws that dictate structures.   
• Regulators interpret those laws, propose new ones, and selectively enforce them. 
• Government administrators propose laws, veto laws, and use their influence in a myriad of 
ways to promote their interests.  In some countries, they also write the laws.   
• Judges interpret laws and write new case law.   
• Exchanges, brokers, clearing agencies, and information providers freely create any market 
structures that the legal system permits.  They also frequently propose—and sometimes even 
implement—structures that laws and regulations do not currently permit.   
• Issuers influence market structure through the decisions they make about where to list their 
securities.

• Traders likewise influence market structure through the decisions they make about where to 
trade.   
• Investors and the general public influence market structure by voting for politicians that 
favor their interests and by lobbying those politicians.   
• Finally, the leaders of trade organizations, public interest groups, and watchdog agencies 
often lobby on behalf of their constituents.   
These people all discuss market structure with those who have power to promote or frustrate 
their interests. 
Debate generally is most productive when conducted within a framework for making decisions.  
Welfare economics provides such a framework.  Welfare economics is the branch of economics 
that considers how we should organize our economy.  In this chapter, we consider principals by 
which we should organize our markets. 
How markets should be organized is completely subjective.  Everyone is entitled to his or her 
own opinion.  Many people think that markets should do well whatever it is that they do.  
Accordingly, we will closely consider the benefits that markets produce for our economy.  At the 
end of this chapter, I provide a set of weak objectives that I believe regulators should use when 
evaluating alternative market structures.  You may have your own opinion about what are good 
markets. 
If you agree that markets should be organized to maximize the benefits that they produce for the 
economy, then you must be familiar with these benefits so that you can consider them when you 
evaluate alternative policies.  If you believe that markets should be organized to promote other 
objectives, you should at least be aware of the costs to the economy of the policies that your 
objectives favor.   
Even if you have no interest in influencing market structures, you should find these discussions 
interesting.  Well-functioning markets are largely responsible for the tremendous wealth that free 
market-based economies have generated and continue to generate.  This chapter helps explain 
why some countries are rich while other countries are poor. 
We start our discussion with a brief introduction to welfare economics.  The discussion then 
turns to the benefits that markets produce for individuals and for the wider economy.  If your 
only interest in this book is to become a better trader, you can safely skip this chapter.   
9.1 Welfare Economics 
Welfare economics involves positive and normative economic analyses.  In positive economic 
analyses, analysts use theories and empirical evidence to predict the consequences of various 
economic policies.  Positive economics is objective in the sense that analysts who use the same 
assumptions and the same data should obtain the same results.  In normative economic analyses, 
analysts argue for specific economic policies.  Normative economics is highly subjective.  
Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about what should be. 
Normative analysts arrive at their conclusions by finding the policy that maximizes a subjective 
measure of social welfare.  The conclusions may flow from formal mathematical models based 
on rigorous statistical analyses or from simple heuristic arguments based on best guesses.  Either 
way, a proper normative argument has four parts:


<!-- PAGE 44 -->

Professor Larry Harris 
Trading and Exchanges 
Draft Copy

Draft: March 5, 2002 
9-3 
1. An identification of all reasonable alternative policies. 
2. A specification of subjective criteria for evaluating the alternative policies.  The criteria 
describe a social welfare function that measures the value of each policy.  If the social 
welfare function is based on multiple criteria, it must specify the acceptable trade-offs among 
the various criteria.  
3. A positive economic analysis that evaluates the social welfare of each alternative policy. 
4. An identification of the policy that produces the greatest social welfare. 
All normative analysts should follow this procedure.  In practice, most follow it implicitly rather 
than explicitly.  This procedure provides a valuable framework for debate because it clearly 
identifies the criteria upon which analysts base their conclusions.  Without this discipline, 
proponents of a policy often argue for it as though it were the objective rather than the path to 
some commonly agreed upon objective.  When policy becomes the objective rather than the 
means to the objective, poor results often follow.  
Do Economists Disagree Much? 
The public widely believes that economists rarely agree with each other.  Consider the popular 
joke, “Put two economists in a room, and you get three opinions.” 
Economists actually agree more than they disagree.  They appear to disagree a lot because people 
remember controversies more than agreements.  Since economic controversies interest us, 
economists often appear to disagree.  
When economists disagree about positive analyses, they usually have based their analyses on 
different assumptions or different data.  Since analysts must make many decisions about which 
assumptions and which data to incorporate into their studies, policymakers must be careful when 
interpreting economic analyses.  They must ensure that the subjective biases of the analysts do 
not influence their results.   
When economists disagree about assumptions and relevant data, we need a set of principles to 
evaluate the decisions that underlie their analyses.  The norms of economic science provide us 
with these principles:  We should evaluate assumptions by how well they represent the essential 
reality of the problem at hand rather than whether we like their policy implications.  Likewise, 
we should evaluate data by how well they characterize relevant past experience rather than by 
whether we like their policy implications.   
When economists disagree about normative analyses, they usually have employed different 
social welfare functions.  Economists—like everyone else—have different opinions as to what is 
good and valuable.  Policymakers must consider whether they agree with the analyst’s values 
before accepting the conclusions of a normative analysis.  
 
9.1.1 Market Welfare Economics 
To decide public policy in the markets, we need an objective by which we can measure the 
merits of alternative policies.  Many people believe that we should design markets to do well 
whatever it is that they do.  Whether you subscribe to this objective or not, you must understand 
what markets do to responsibly evaluate public policy.

Speculators 
 
We now turn our attention to the three main types of profit-motivated speculators. 
We consider informed traders in the Chapter 10.  Informed traders are well informed about 
fundamental values.  Their trading makes prices more informative.  
We study order anticipators in Chapter 11.  Order anticipators are well informed about what 
other traders intend do.  They front run other traders and thereby reduce their profits.  Their 
trading often makes prices less informative.  
In Chapter 12, we examine bluffers.  Bluffers try to fool other traders into believing that they 
have information about future price changes.  Their trading usually makes prices less 
informative.

Chapter 10 
Informed Traders and Market Efficiency 
Informed traders are speculators who acquire and act on information about fundamental values.  
They buy when prices are below their estimates of fundamental value and sell when prices are 
above their estimates.  Informed traders include value traders, news traders, information-
oriented technical traders, and arbitrageurs. 
In this chapter, we will consider how informed traders trade, and how their trading makes prices 
informative.  We will pay special attention to why some informed traders make money while 
others do not.  We also will explain why prices cannot be completely informative.  This chapter 
will help you understand how informed traders make money, when they make money, and the 
limits to how much money they can make. 
Informed trading may interest you for at least three reasons.  First, you may be an informed 
trader yourself.  If your trading decisions depend in any way on opinions you form about 
fundamental values, you are an informed trader.  Unfortunately, most traders who believe that 
they are informed traders do not trade profitably because they are not truly well informed.  The 
principles we will discuss in this chapter should improve your trading by helping you predict 
when you will trade profitably.   
Second, you must understand informed trading to understand the risks that traders face when 
they offer liquidity.  In Chapter 13 (Dealers), we show that dealers and other traders who supply 
liquidity lose to well-informed traders.  The profitability of dealer operations therefore depends 
critically on how dealers cope with informed traders.  If you intend to be a dealer, if you intend 
to trade with them, or if you intend to offer liquidity yourself, you must understand informed 
trading.   
Finally, you must understand informed trading to see how prices become informative.  A price is 
informative when it is near its corresponding fundamental value.  Informative prices are 
extremely valuable to the economy because they help us allocate resources efficiently.  To fully 
appreciate how market-orientated economies work, you must understand how informed traders 
make prices informative.   
10.1 Fundamental Values 
To discuss informed trading, we must distinguish between market values and fundamental 
values.  The market value of an instrument is the price at which traders can buy or sell the 
instrument.  The fundamental value (or intrinsic value) is the “true value” of the instrument.  In 
financial terms, fundamental value is the expected present value of all present and future benefits 
and costs associated with holding the instrument.  Everyone would agree upon this value if they 
all knew everything known about the instrument, if they all used the proper analyses to predict 
and discount all uncertain future cash flows, and if they all perceived the benefits and costs of 
holding the instrument equally.  Since these conditions never occur, traders often differ in their 
opinions about fundamental values.  This chapter examines how informed traders estimate 
fundamental values, and how they trade upon their estimates. 
Fundamental values are not perfect foresight values.  Fundamental values depend only on 
information that is currently available to traders.  Perfect foresight values depend on all current


<!-- PAGE 47 -->

Draft: March 1, 2002 
10-2 
and future information about values.  Fundamental values are the best estimates of perfect 
foresight values. 
Prices are completely informative when they equal fundamental values.  Efficient markets 
produce prices that are very informative.  The difference between fundamental value and market 
value (price) is noise.  Informed traders try to identify the noise in prices by estimating 
fundamental values.  Since we do not observe fundamental values, we cannot easily determine 
whether prices are informative or noisy. 
Fischer Black on Noise 
Fischer Black was a mathematician who made many seminal contributions to the development of 
financial theory.  Perhaps most notably, he helped develop option-pricing theory, for which 
Myron Scholes and Robert Merton received the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economic Science.  Had 
Fischer not died two years before the Prize was awarded, he undoubtedly also would have been a 
Nobel laureate. 
In his 1985 presidential address to the American Finance Association, Black offered a now 
famous opinion about noise.  He believed that we should consider stock prices to be informative 
if they are between one-half and twice their fundamental values!  Most economists believe that 
the prices of actively traded securities are well within these extreme bounds, but no one can 
know for sure. 
Source:  Fischer Black, 1986, “Noise,” Journal of Finance 41(3), 529-543.  
 
Changes in fundamental values are completely unpredictable.  Since fundamental values reflect 
all available information, they change only when traders learn unexpected new fundamental 
information.  If fundamental value changes were predictable, current fundamental values would 
not fully reflect the information upon which the predictions are based.  Fundamental value 
changes therefore must be unpredictable.  Since prices are very close to fundamental values in 
efficient markets, price changes in efficient markets are quite unpredictable. 
When traders cannot predict future price changes, statisticians say that prices follow a random 
walk.  Plots of random walks through time look like paths that wander up or down at random 
because random walks are completely unpredictable. 
10.2 Informed Traders  
Informed traders estimate fundamental values.  They may base their estimates on private 
information that only they have, or on public information that any trader can obtain.  Informed 
traders compare their value estimates with the corresponding market prices.  They consider 
instruments to be undervalued if prices are less than their estimates of fundamental value, and 
overvalued if prices are greater.   
Informed traders buy instruments that they believe are significantly undervalued and sell 
instruments that they believe are significantly overvalued.  They hope to profit when the prices 
of their purchases rise, and when the prices of their sales fall.  Informed traders naturally hope 
that these price changes will occur quickly. 
Informed traders lose money when they estimate fundamental values poorly.  When their value 
estimates are wrong, they pay too much for instruments they have overvalued, and they sell too


<!-- PAGE 48 -->

10-3 
cheaply those instruments that they have undervalued.  Informed traders who consistently 
estimate values poorly usually quit trading when they have lost more money than they can 
tolerate or when bankruptcy forces them out of the markets.   
Informed traders also can lose money even if they accurately estimate fundamental values.  This 
happens when prices move away from fundamental values rather than towards them.  These 
losses, however, tend to be short-term losses.  In the long run, prices usually revert toward their 
fundamental values so that well-informed traders ultimately profit. 
Even if prices never adjust to their fundamental values, well-informed traders who have correctly 
estimated values still can profit from their trades if they are patient.  When they buy an 
undervalued instrument, they acquire the rights of ownership for less than their aggregate value.  
By holding the instrument, they will eventually receive the benefits of these rights—typically 
interest, dividends, royalties, capital repayments, or liquidating distributions—at a lower price 
than they could otherwise obtain them.  When they sell overvalued instruments, they can invest 
the proceeds in instruments with higher expected rates of return.   
10.3 Informed Traders Make Prices Informative 
Informed traders, like all other traders, often significantly impact prices when they trade.  Their 
buying tends to push prices up, and their selling tends to push prices down.  Since they buy when 
price is below their estimates of fundamental value and sell otherwise, the effect of their trading 
is to move prices toward their estimates of fundamental value.  Their trading therefore causes 
prices to reflect their estimates of fundamental value.  When informed traders accurately estimate 
values, their trading makes prices more informative. 
Informed traders generally differ in their estimates of value.  This often happens when they base 
their estimates on different data.  Informed traders often trade with each other so that the price 
impacts of their trading tend to cancel.  The net impact of their trading is a market price that 
reflects an average of their different value estimates.  This price usually is more informative than 
are any of the individual value estimates.  Markets aggregate data from many sources to produce 
prices that typically estimate fundamental values more accurately than can any individual trader.  
An Algebraic Illustration 
This box presents an algebraic illustration of how markets aggregate information.  If you are not 
comfortable with algebra and symbolic notation, skip it.  The exercise only illustrates points 
made in the text.  
Suppose that N traders each produce a different forecast of the true value of a security.  Let fi be 
the forecast of the ith trader and assume that it is an unbiased estimate of V, the true fundamental 
value.  We can represent the forecast as f
V
e
i
i
=
+
 where ei is the error in the ith trader’s

Order Anticipators 
Order anticipators are speculators who try to profit by trading before other traders trade.  They 
make money when they correctly anticipate how other traders will affect prices or when they can 
extract option values from the orders that other traders offer to the market. 
Order anticipators include front runners, sentiment-oriented technical traders, and squeezers.  
Front runners collect information about trades that other traders have decided to arrange.  
Sentiment-oriented technical traders try to predict trades that uninformed traders will decide to 
make.  Squeezers try to exploit traders who must trade by cornering the market. 
Order anticipators are parasitic traders.  They profit only when they can prey on other traders.  
They do not make prices more informative, and they do not make markets more liquid.  To trade 
profitably, you must avoid these traders.  You therefore must understand how they trade. 
Large traders are especially vulnerable to order anticipators.  You must be familiar with parasitic 
traders to understand how large traders expose their orders.   
Some front runners obtain their information about trader intentions from brokers.  If you trade 
with brokers, if you are a broker, if you are interested in becoming a broker, or if you regulate 
brokers, you must know how brokers occasionally unwittingly or intentionally expose orders. 
Trading by order anticipators often makes prices more volatile and markets less efficient.  If 
volatility and price efficiency interest you, you must consider how order anticipators affect the 
markets. 
Uninformed traders sometimes significantly affect prices.  Traders who can predict what 
uninformed traders will do therefore can sometimes profit from that knowledge.  If you have 
these skills, how sentiment-oriented technical traders trade should interest you.   
Even if you cannot predict what uninformed traders will do, you may be able to identify what 
uninformed traders have done after the fact.  Although you cannot profit directly from this 
information, you can use it to better understand why your trading strategies worked or failed.  
Understanding how sentiment-oriented technical traders collect and process information will 
help you to better understand uninformed traders. 
In markets that enforce time precedence, order anticipators must improve price by at least the 
minimum price increment to trade ahead of other traders.  The size of the price increment 
therefore greatly affects the profitability of order anticipator strategies in such markets.  You 
must be familiar with how order anticipation trading strategies to form reasonable opinions about 
the proper size of the minimum price increment.  
11.1 Front Runners 
Front runners collect information about trades that other traders have decided to arrange.  They 
then try to trade before those traders complete their trades.  Front runners may obtain their 
information from public sources, from the traders they front run, or from brokers.  Practitioners 
call them front runners because they hurry (run) to trade before (in front of) other traders.

Front-running strategies differ according to the type of trader that they front run.  Front runners 
may trade in front of aggressive traders or passive traders.  Aggressive traders demand liquidity 
while passive traders offer liquidity.   
11.1.1 Front Running Aggressive Traders 
Aggressive traders usually issue market orders.  Their demands often push prices up when they 
buy and push prices down when they sell.  Front runners who trade ahead of aggressive traders 
profit from the price impact of the aggressive traders’ trades. 
In most markets, front running is illegal when the front runner improperly obtains information 
about the incoming order.  Front runners obtain information improperly when they violate a 
confidential brokerage relationship or when they eavesdrop on confidential communications.  
These violations may take place at any point between the receipt of the order by the broker and 
its final execution.   
An Illegal Front-running Scheme Involving a Violation of Confidentiality 
Rob is a runner who works for a large brokerage house on the floor of a futures exchange.  Rob’s 
job is to carry orders from his firm’s telephone booth on the perimeter of the exchange floor to 
his firm’s brokers in various trading pits.   
Nate trades commodity futures for his own account in one of those pits.  He and Rob have 
arranged a set of signals by which Rob can surreptitiously tell Nate that he is carrying a large buy 
or sell order.  They may convey their signal by a glance at a clock, by the hand in which Rob 
carries the order, by the placement of a pen in a pocket or behind an ear, or by some other means.  
Rob and Nate employ a variety of signals to make it difficult for anyone to detect what they are 
doing.   
When Nate sees the signal for a large buy order, he immediately buys contracts for his own 
account.  After Rob delivers the order to his firm’s broker, the broker buys contracts to fill it.  
Nate profits as the broker pushes the price up to fill the order.  Nate sometimes even sells his 
newly acquired contracts to the broker.  Afterwards, Nate and Rob split the profits.   
Their profits come at the expense of the broker’s customers.  The customers pay higher prices 
when buying and obtain lower prices when selling because Nate takes liquidity that they 
otherwise would have taken.  
This scheme is very difficult to detect in actively traded markets.  To prevent it, brokerage firms, 
their customers, and exchanges must carefully watch how prices change before and after orders 
arrive.  They must try to remember who traded before large orders arrived so that they can 
identify systematic patterns that might suggest a front-running problem. 
Brokers also must secure their communications to prevent these schemes.  At several exchanges, 
new wireless electronic order delivery systems eliminate the need for floor runners and thereby 
remove potential for fraud in that link of the order transmission chain.  
 
Not all front running is illegal.  Observant traders on the floor of an exchange can often infer an 
order from how a broker handles it.  Brokers must be especially careful to avoid revealing their 
orders inadvertently.

Legal Front Running by an Observant Trader 
Rifka and Jon have both traded on the same options floor for years.  Although they are not 
friends, their close proximity to each other has allowed them to become very well acquainted.  
Rifka trades for her own account.  Jon is a floor broker for a large firm.   
Rifka has noticed that Jon behaves slightly differently when he receives a large order than a 
small order.  The differences are very subtle; Rifka cannot even articulate what she sees.  She 
just knows from experience when Jon has a large order.   
Jon’s behavior does not reveal whether the order is a buy or sell order.  Rifka often guesses 
correctly since she has noticed that Jon tends to buy after he has bought and sell after he has 
sold: At least one of Jon’s clients probably splits his or her large orders.   
When Rifka suspects that Jon has received a large order, she will try to front run it.  If she feels 
confident about the side of the order, she may try to beat Jon to the market.  Otherwise, she will 
wait to see which side Jon needs to trade.  She may then better his price and hope to make a 
profit when Jon’s client returns to the market.  
Rifka’s trading is legal.  Her profits come from recognizing Jon’s shortcomings as a broker and 
from noting that Jon’s clients tend to split their orders.  She is a profitable trader because she is 
observant and because she acts quickly on her information. 
 
Front runners sometimes also obtain information about orders when brokers call them to arrange 
trades.  Brokers who want to arrange a large trade must call traders who they think might be 
willing to take the other side.  They often reveal their orders in these calls.  Although front 
runners may legally exploit this information, those who do risk harming their relationships with 
these brokers.  Brokers must be very careful to expose orders only to those traders who will most 
likely take the other side.  They most avoid exposing their orders to traders who would front run 
their clients.   
Shop the Block 
Brokers shop the block when they expose large orders.  Not surprisingly, prices tend to rise when 
they widely shop a large block buy order, and fall when they widely shop a large block sell 
order. 
 
Front runners capture the benefits of price discrimination that large traders would otherwise 
obtain.  In continuous auctions, large traders typically split their orders so that they can 
discriminate among the traders who offer them liquidity.  They want to trade first with those 
traders offering the best prices and then, if necessary, with traders offering inferior prices.  
Splitting their orders thus produces a better average price than they would obtain if they had to 
fill their entire order at a single price.  Front runners appropriate the benefits of price 
discrimination by taking liquidity from the traders offering the best prices.  They then offer this 
liquidity back to the large traders at inferior prices.  The effect of a successful front-running 
strategy is to force large traders to pay more uniform prices to fill their orders. 
Under some very limited circumstances, front runners can be valuable to large traders.  If front 
runners can find liquidity more cheaply than can large traders, the front runners may lower the 
costs of trading large sizes.  To be of value to large traders, front runners must consolidate the

Chapter 12 
Bluffers and Market Manipulation 
Bluffers are profit-motivated traders who try to fool other traders into trading unwisely.  The 
bluffers then profit from those foolish traders.  To trade profitably, you must avoid trading with 
bluffers.   
Bluffers use two techniques to fool their victims.  Rumormongers spread information that they 
hope will encourage people to trade as the bluffers want them to trade.  The information may be 
false information, or it may be true information presented in a manner or under circumstances 
that would cause traders to misinterpret it.  Price manipulators arrange trades at prices, volumes, 
and times that they hope will change people's opinions about instrument values.  The trades may 
be real market trades properly arranged at arm's length, or they may be wash trades that they 
arrange with confederates to create artificial market activity.  Both bluffing techniques present 
the bluffers' victims with information that the bluffers hope will cause them to make false 
inferences about values.  In both cases, bluffers try to convince other traders that they are well-
informed traders.   
Painting the Markets 
Traders say that price manipulators paint the tape when they trade to influence other traders.  
Traders coined this term when automated telegraph printers reported trades to off-floor traders.  
These printers—called tickers because of the sounds that they made—produced long paper 
ribbons called ticker tapes.  Traders who paint the tape cause the price record to appear 
differently than it otherwise would appear.   
Traders also say that price manipulators paint a picture when they produce information that does 
not reflect true market conditions.  Manipulators hope that other traders will mistake their 
pictures for reality.   
 
Market manipulation occurs when bluffers or their victims cause prices to change from what 
they would be if the bluffers did not pursue their bluffing strategies.  Market manipulation is 
illegal in the United States and many other countries.  It is very difficult to catch, however.  If the 
bluffers do not openly fabricate information or arrange wash trades with conspirators, they often 
can easily defend themselves by claiming that they were engaged in legitimate trading strategies.   
Traders who offer liquidity to other traders must be especially careful not to offer liquidity to 
bluffers.  To avoid losing to bluffers, liquidity suppliers must be very careful when they make 
inferences about values from prices and volumes.  If they make these inferences poorly, bluffers 
may manipulate their trading and thereby profit.  To fully understand how traders supply 
liquidity, you must understand how bluffers discipline liquidity suppliers. 
This chapter starts with an illustration of a bluff.  We then formally characterize bluffing.  We 
discuss how bluffs work, why they sometime fail, and why regulators cannot easily enforce laws 
against market manipulation.  The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of 
bluffing for traders who offer liquidity.

12.1 A Long Side Bluff 
Bluffing is best introduced with an example.  In the following invented example, Bill undertakes 
a long side bluff.  In a long side bluff, a bluffer tries to profit by buying at low prices and selling 
later at higher prices.  Our example has two endings.  In the first ending, Bill successfully 
completes his bluff and makes great profits.  In the second ending, value traders call Bill’s bluff, 
and he loses heavily.   
After some careful research, Bill decides that the stock of a small firm named Bubbles Never 
Burst (BNB) is a good candidate for his bluff.  BNB is a young firm that has developed a new 
emulsifier with potentially valuable applications ranging from bathtub soaps to industrial foams.  
The stock is followed by many investors who are excited by its growth prospects.  Most of them 
know little or nothing about the underlying chemistry.  BNB currently has no earnings and is 
trading for 5 dollars a share.  The firm has 8 million common shares outstanding of which 
management holds 70 percent.   
Bill starts his bluff by buying BNB shares as quietly as he can.  Using limit orders, he patiently 
waits for the market to come to him.  Because other traders also occasionally want to buy the 
stock, the price starts to rise.  Over the next 40 trading days, Bill buys 200,000 shares at prices 
ranging from 5 dollars to 7 dollars.  His average trade price is 6 dollars.   
On the 31st trading day, and continuing thereafter, Bill starts to praise the stock extensively in 
messages he posts to various Internet message boards.  He describes BNB's technology in 
substantial detail as though he fully understood it.  He also provides very optimistic cash flow 
projections for applications of the technology.  His messages draw heavily on information 
presented in BNB's most recent 10-Q and 10-K reports.  He posts these messages using several 
different usernames so that it appears that the stock is widely followed.  He even has his various 
usernames spar with each other on the message boards to strengthen the impression that they 
represent different people.  Of course, his pessimistic usernames eventually concede winning 
points to his optimistic usernames. 
On the morning of the 41st trading day, BNB independently issues a press release that announces 
that it will be producing its new emulsifiers in China.  The news is not surprising to anyone who 
read BNB's last 10-Q report in which BNB provided a positive status report of its efforts to 
produce in China.  Several electronic news services receive electronic copies of the press release.  
Most news service editors run the story by publishing an exact or slightly edited copy of BNB’s 
press release.   
Bill sees the news immediately because he subscribes to a real time information service that he 
has programmed to alert him whenever stories about BNB appear.  Although the announcement 
has no particular fundamental value, Bill quickly decides that it represents the opportunity for 
which he has been waiting.  Bill immediately submits market orders to buy 50,000 shares of 
BNB stock.  He divides the orders into several parts and submits them to different brokers 
without telling them about the other parts.  When the orders converge on the market, the price 
rapidly rises.  In 20 minutes, the price rises from 7 dollars to 10 dollars as Bill buys 50,000 
shares at an average price of 8.5 dollars.  At the end of the hour, several news services are 
reporting that BNB is up substantially for the day on unusually large volume.  BNB also appears 
on various electronic intraday lists of the largest daily price gainers.

Bill also starts posting notes to the Internet bulletin boards about the importance of the China 
information.  His notes now project price targets of 20 and 25 dollars per share, with the 
possibility of more than 50 dollars a share by the time the new plant comes on line. 
12.1.1 The Successful Ending:  Bill Profits 
Some traders who follow BNB closely see the price change.  They immediately query their 
electronic information retrieval services to determine why the stock is moving, and when it 
started to move.  They find the story about producing in China and see that the price increase 
immediately followed its publication.   
Although the news has no particular fundamental value, many traders infer more from the story 
than they should because of the large positive price change that followed the announcement.  
They mistakenly conclude that other traders believe that the story is extremely good news.  They 
foolishly ask themselves, "Why else would the market have gone up?"  They convince 
themselves that someone obviously thinks that the stock is a good value.  In light of this 
information, they then reevaluate their opinions about BNB.  BNB’s technology now seems 
more promising, and the firm's prospects look much brighter than when they last thought about 
the company.  They say to themselves, "Because I certainly am among the first to see this news, I 
probably can still profit by buying BNB stock.  If I wait too long, price will continue to rise, and 
I will have lost my opportunity."  These traders then buy the stock.  Since they are afraid that 
others may soon come to the same conclusion that they have, they submit market orders to trade 
quickly.   
Traders who buy when the market is rising and sell when it is falling are momentum traders.  
They are particularly susceptible to bluffs.  
These momentum traders primarily buy their stock from Bill!  Bill lets the stock continue to rise 
to close at 12 as he sells 100,000 shares at an average price of 11 dollars.   
By late afternoon, the stock exchange has contacted the CFO of BNB about the price rise.  She 
reports that management is completely mystified by the events.  The firm considers issuing a 
second press release stating that they have no idea why their stock price is rising.  BNB’s 
attorney, however, advises against doing so for fear of exposing the firm to lawsuits.  When 
news service reporters call, management declines to comment stating that they have a policy of 
not commenting on market fluctuations.   
By the next day (Day 42), many other traders have seen the price rise.  Some believe that it 
indicates that the stock may do very well in the future.  Others have read Bill's notes on the 
various Internet bulletin boards and now agree that the stock probably is undervalued.  These 
traders also may have seen news stories reporting that BNB declined to comment on the burst in 
market activity.  They interpret the refusal as a further indication that something is happening.  
These foolish traders try to buy the stock.   
Other traders believe that the stock may be overvalued, but most are not willing to act on their 
opinion since they are not sure whether other, more significant, fundamental information might 
account for the large price rise.  Still others think that the stock is overvalued, but are unwilling 
to sell it because they expect that it will rise further.   
Bill sells heavily throughout the day, along with a few value traders.  The stock peaks at 13 
dollars and then drops to 8 dollars on very high volume.  Bill sells his remaining 150,000 shares

Part IV 
Liquidity Suppliers 
 
This part of the book examines how and why traders supply liquidity to other traders.  We start 
in Chapter 13 by discussing dealers.  Dealers make markets.  They allow other traders to quickly 
trade small size.  Dealers tend to be high frequency traders who do not know much about with 
whom they trade or the fundamental values of the instruments that they trade.  
Chapter 14 then examines bid/ask spreads in dealer markets and in order-driven markets.  The 
discussions in this chapter will help you to better understand the determinants of transaction 
costs.   
Chapter 15 considers how block traders arrange large trades.  Block traders find liquidity for 
traders who want to trade large sizes.  Block traders generally know their clients well.  
We consider value traders in Chapter 16.  They are the ultimate suppliers of liquidity.  These 
highly informed traders often supply great depth when they believe that prices do not reflect 
fundamental values.  
We introduce arbitrageurs in Chapter 17.  Arbitrageurs are informed traders who move liquidity 
from one market to the other.  You must understand their trading strategies well to appreciate the 
economic effects of competition among market centers for order flows.   
Chapter 18 considers how public traders create order submission strategies.  These decisions 
determine whether they supply liquidity or take liquidity.  When public traders are willing to 
supply liquidity, they can often displace dealers.

Chapter 13 
Dealers 
Dealers are merchants who make money by buying low and selling high.  What you already 
know about merchants will help you understand how dealers in the financial markets trade 
profitably.  
Merchants may be dealers or distributors.  Dealers buy from, and sell to, their clients.  
Distributors buy from their suppliers and sell to their clients.  (In practice, many distributors are 
also commonly known as dealers.  Consider, for example, new car dealers.)  Traders act as 
dealers when they make a market in seasoned securities or in contracts.  They act as distributors 
when they help firms sell new securities or when they help a client sell a large block of 
securities. 
All dealers face the same problems regardless of what they trade.  They must set prices, they 
must market their services to acquire clients, they must manage their inventories, and they must 
be careful that they do not trade with better-informed traders.  The relative importance of these 
problems varies by what the dealers trade.   
Dealers in the financial markets supply liquidity to their clients who want to buy and sell trading 
instruments.  They allow people to trade when they want to trade.  They buy when their clients 
want to sell, and they sell when their clients want to buy. 
Dealers make money by buying at low prices and selling at high prices.  They lose money when 
market conditions force them to sell at low prices or buy at high prices.  These losses often occur 
after they trade with informed traders. 
When dealers purchase something, they usually do not know to whom they will sell it or at what 
price they will sell it.  If the price drops before they can sell the item, they lose money.  
Likewise, when they sell something, they usually do not know the price that they will pay to 
repurchase it.  These unknowns make being a dealer challenging, exciting, and very risky.  
Dealers assume significant risks when they trade. 
Dealers are passive traders.  Passive traders trade when other traders want to trade.  Since 
passive traders do not control the timing of their trades, they must be very careful about how they 
offer to trade and to whom they offer to trade.  They must ensure that when they do trade, their 
trades benefit them and not just their clients.  Dealers must be especially vigilant to avoid losing 
to informed traders and bluffers. 
In this chapter, we will examine the principles by which dealers conduct their businesses.  You 
will learn how dealers set their quotes, how they manage their inventories, how they respond to 
informed traders, and how they learn about the values of the instruments that they trade.  The 
principles that we will discuss apply to all dealers whether they trade securities, commodities, or 
retail goods.  If you are—or intend to be—a dealer, understanding these principles will help you 
maximize your trading profits.  
Even if you have no interest in being a dealer, you must understand how dealers behave to trade 
successfully in financial markets.  Whether you trade with dealers or compete with them to offer 
liquidity, their trading decisions affect you.  In particular, you must consider how dealers trade 
when you decide whether to take or offer liquidity.

In markets where dealers are the primary suppliers of liquidity, the cost of liquidity depends on 
the factors that determine dealer profits.  If you are interested in market liquidity, you must 
understand how dealers trade, and when they are profitable.   
We start this chapter with introductory discussions about who dealers are, how traders negotiate 
with dealers, and how dealers attract order flow.  We then consider how dealers control their 
inventories, and how they set their prices.  The chapter closes by examining how dealers relate to 
value traders and to bluffers. 
13.1 Who Are Dealers? 
Dealers are profit-motivated traders who allow other traders to trade when they want to trade.  
The liquidity service they sell—immediacy—is valuable to impatient traders.  Dealers profit 
when they buy from impatient sellers at low prices and sell to impatient buyers at high prices.  
The difference in prices compensates them for providing immediacy.  
Many dealers are professional traders who work on the floors of exchanges or in the offices of 
trading firms.  These professionals sometimes use computer systems to support their dealing or 
to implement their trading strategies.   
Other dealers are individuals who access the markets through their brokers, often via Internet 
order entry systems.  Such traders generally supply immediacy by issuing limit orders.  These 
individuals often do not recognize that they are acting as dealers.  They consequently do not 
always fully appreciate the risks that they face and the circumstances under which they will lose 
or profit.   
Many markets officially register some traders as dealers.  In exchange for some special 
privileges, these markets may require that their registered dealers supply liquidity.  We discuss 
these arrangements in Chapter 24 (Specialists).   
Dealers often are known by other names.  At futures exchanges, dealers are often called scalpers, 
day traders, locals, or market makers.  At many stock exchanges and options exchanges, they are 
known as specialists or market makers.   
Many dealers are also brokers.  We discuss brokers and the dual trading problem that broker-
dealers present in Chapter 7 (Brokers). 
In addition to offering liquidity to other traders, many dealers also speculate.  Dealers sometimes 
can predict future price changes by inferring the reasons why traders demand to trade.  They also 
can use quote-matching strategies to capture the option values of limit orders that they see.  In 
many actively traded markets, competition among dealers may be so intense that dealers cannot 
profit only by providing liquidity to customers.  In such markets, dealers must speculate 
successfully to stay in business.  Dealers who must speculate to stay in business are sometimes 
called position traders as opposed to spread traders.  Spread traders profit exclusively from 
buying at the bid and selling at the ask. 
In this chapter, we consider only how dealers supply liquidity.  Although we discuss how dealers 
infer information from the order flow, and how they react to it, we do not consider how they may 
speculate on it.  Chapters 10 (Informed Trading) and 11 (Order Anticipators) examine the 
speculative trading strategies that dealers most often employ.

13-3 
Because dealing can be quite risky, successful dealers tend to be traders who tolerate risks well.  
They generally do not enjoy bearing them, however.  The risks of dealing are serious and scary.  
Many dealers have gone bankrupt because they assumed risks that did not work out.  Dealers 
constantly think about the risks that they bear and how to avoid them.  Since bearing risk is 
unpleasant, dealers demand appropriate compensation when forced to bear large risks. 
13.2 Dealer Quotations 
The prices at which dealers are willing to buy and sell are their bid and ask prices.  Dealers 
usually quote these prices to their clients before they trade.  Dealers bid to buy at their bid prices 
and offer to sell at their ask prices.  Sellers receive bid prices when they sell to dealers, and 
buyers pay ask prices when they buy from dealers.  Ask prices are also known as offering prices.   
Traders who want to buy from a trader who is offering to sell take the offer.  Traders who want 
to sell to a trader who is offering to buy hit the bid.  
Dealers always set their ask prices above their bid prices.  The difference between the ask and 
the bid is the bid/ask spread.  When the ask is close to the bid, the spread is narrow, or tight.  
When the ask is much higher than the bid, the spread is wide. 
Dealers make money by buying low at their bid prices and selling high at their ask prices.  This 
strategy is profitable if dealers can fill orders on both sides of the market without changing their 
prices.  In practice, this strategy is quite difficult to implement profitably because dealers rarely 
receive buy and sell orders in equal volumes, and because unforeseen price changes are very 
common.   
The realized spreads that dealers earn are often smaller than their quoted spreads.  The realized 
spread is the difference between the prices at which dealers actually buy and sell.  Realized 
spreads are usually smaller than quoted spreads because dealers occasionally trade at better 
prices than they quote and because dealers often adjust their bid and ask prices between trades. 
Example of a Small Realized Spread 
Dell is a dealer who is bidding 35.0 and offering 35.3 for a security.  A client arrives and sells at 
Dell’s bid of 35.0.  Dell now needs to sell the security to restore her former position.  
Bad news about the fundamental value of the security subsequently arrives.  To avoid buying 
from well-informed traders, Dell must lower her bid to 34.6.  To encourage traders to buy from 
her so that she can sell the security, she must lower her ask to 34.9.   
A buyer arrives and buys from Dell at 34.9.  Although Dell’s quoted bid/ask spread before both 
trades was 0.3, the realized spread for her roundtrip buy and sell was −0.1 = 34.9 − 35.0.  Dell 
lost money because she was holding the stock when its value dropped. 
 
Dealers who quote both bid and ask prices quote a two-sided market.  Their quotes make a 
market.  Those who quote only one side quote a one-sided market.  Although most dealers will 
quote a two-sided market, they usually aggressively price only the side on which they would 
prefer to trade.  For example, dealers who want to buy usually quote high (aggressive) bid prices 
to encourage sellers to sell to them.  They also quote high uncompetitive ask prices to discourage 
buyers from buying from them.  Dealers who want to sell likewise quote low bid and ask prices.

The bid/ask spread is the price impatient traders pay for immediacy.  Impatient traders buy at the 
ask price and sell at the bid price.  The spread is the compensation dealers and limit order traders 
receive for offering immediacy. 
The spread is the most important factor that traders consider when they decide whether to submit 
limit orders or market orders.  When the spread is wide, immediacy is expensive, market order 
executions are costly, and limit order submission strategies are attractive.  When the spread is 
narrow, immediacy is cheap, and market order strategies are attractive.  If you are interested in 
optimizing your order submission strategies, you must understand what determines bid/ask 
spreads so that you can judge whether they are wide or narrow, given current market conditions. 
The spread is also the most important factor that dealers consider when they decide whether to 
offer liquidity in a market.  If the spread is too narrow, dealing may not be profitable, and dealers 
may quit trading.  If it is wide, dealing will be profitable, and other dealers may enter the market.  
If you are interested in dealer profitability, you must understand the factors that determine 
bid/ask spreads.  
In this chapter, we will consider what determines bid/ask spreads in dealer markets and in order-
driven markets.  We will discuss when immediacy is expensive, when it is cheap, and why.  The 
most important factors that determine spreads are adverse selection due to well-informed traders, 
volatility, and market activity.  We will closely examine these factors and many others. 
The most important lesson you may learn from this book appears in this chapter.  You will learn 
why uninformed traders lose to well-informed traders whether they submit limit orders or market 
orders.  Uninformed traders lose simply because they trade.  If you are an uninformed trader and 
do not want to lose, you should minimize your trading. 
14.1 Dealer Bid/Ask Spreads 
Dealers set their spreads to maximize their profits.  Their spreads must be wide enough to allow 
them to recover their costs of doing business.  Otherwise, they will not be profitable, and they 
will quit dealing.  Their spreads cannot be so wide, however, that no one would trade with them.  
Their revenues then would not cover their expenses. 
Dealers profit when their revenues exceed their expenses.  Dealer revenues depend on the 
effective spreads they earn on their roundtrip trades, on how often they can turn their inventory, 
and on how much they lose to informed traders.  Dealer business expenses reduce their profits.  
Dealer expenses include financing costs for their inventories, wages for their staff, exchange 
membership dues, and expenditures for telecommunications, research, trading system 
development, clearing and settlement, accounting, office space, utilities, and other such items. 
14.1.1 Monopoly Dealers 
When dealers face little competition, they may quote wide spreads to maximize their profits.  
The optimal monopoly spread depends on the demand for their services.  If clients are willing to

trade regardless of the spread, spreads will be wide.  If clients are sensitive to their transaction 
costs, spreads will be low. 
Monopoly dealers set their spreads so that the additional revenue from a slight decrease in spread 
is just equal to the additional cost of providing the additional liquidity that traders will demand at 
the slightly lower spread.  A similar result appears in all introductory economics textbooks.  We 
will not explain it here because dealers can rarely behave as monopolists in financial or 
commodity markets.  
Monopolies are successful only when monopolists can prevent other competitors from entering 
their markets.  In most security and contract markets, the barriers to entry that dealers face are 
low.  Dealers always look for markets in which they can make money.  If dealing profits are 
excessively high in some market, they will enter that market and try to participate in the excess 
profits.  Their entry tends to lower spreads and thereby the profits of all dealers in the market.  
The threat of entry therefore may prevent a dealer from behaving as a monopolist even when no 
other dealers are in the market.  
In many markets, dealers also face competition from public limit order traders.  Limit orders are 
essentially the same as dealer quotes.  Both are offers to trade that other traders may take when 
they want to trade.  Dealers who compete with aggressive public limit order traders cannot earn 
large effective spreads because the limit order traders will undercut their quotes.  
One Dealer Does Not Necessarily a Monopolist Make 
The specialists at the New York Stock Exchange are the unique dealers in their specialty stocks.  
Although their unique positions may give them some market power on the floor of the Exchange, 
they are hardly monopolists.  They face competition from public limit order traders and from 
dealers at other exchanges that trade the same securities.  
 
14.1.2 Spreads in Competitive Dealer Markets 
In competitive dealer markets, dealer spreads ultimately depend on the costs that dealers incur 
running their business.  The free entry and exit of dealers ensures that spreads will adjust so that 
dealers just earn normal profits for providing their liquidity services.  When spreads are too high 
so that incumbent dealers earn excessive profits, new dealers will enter the market.  Their 
competition for order flow will cause spreads to fall.  As the spreads fall, so will the excess 
profits.  If spreads are too low so that dealers are losing money, some will eventually quit since 
nobody can lose money forever.  With less competition, the remaining dealers will be able to 
raise their spreads and thereby decrease their losses.  Only when spreads are set so that dealers 
earn normal profits will dealers neither enter nor leave the market.   
Dealers earn normal profits when their revenues just cover their total economic costs of doing 
business.  These costs include all costs described above, a fair rate of return on their invested 
capital, and fair compensation for their entrepreneurial efforts.  Economists call the difference 
between revenues and the total economic costs of doing business economic profit.  When dealers 
earn normal profits, economic profits are just zero.  Firms that make normal profits have 
accounting profits that just cover the value of the entrepreneurs’ time and the rental of their 
capital.

14.2 Spread Components 
For analytic purposes, economists break the bid/ask spread into two components.  The 
decomposition makes it easier to understand what factors determine bid/ask spreads.   
The transaction cost spread component is that part of the bid/ask spread that compensates 
dealers for their normal costs of doing business.  We enumerated these costs above.  This 
component also funds any monopoly profits that the dealer may make and any risk premium that 
dealers may require for bearing inventory risk. 
The adverse selection spread component is that part of the bid/ask spread that compensates 
dealers for the losses that they suffer when trading with well-informed traders.  This component 
allows dealers to earn from uninformed traders what they lose to informed traders.  We also 
discuss this component in Chapter 13 (Dealers) when we consider how dealers learn about values 
from the order flow.  There we examine the component from an information perspective.  Here 
we examine it from an accounting perspective.  Although the two perspectives are quite 
different, remarkably, both perspectives imply the same sized adverse selection spread 
component.  
The two components taken together constitute the total spread.  Dealers never separately quote 
both components.  They simply quote their bid and ask prices.  To actually estimate the two 
spread components, analysts must use econometric methods.  
14.2.1 The Transaction Cost Component  
If all traders knew instrument values with complete certainty, the transaction cost component 
would constitute the entire spread.  Prices would simply bounce back and forth between bid 
prices, which would be set slightly below instrument values, and ask prices, which would be set 
slightly above instrument values.  Competition among dealers would cause the spread to equal 
the normal costs of doing business.  If dealers had monopoly power, they would set wider 
spreads. 
Economists also call the transaction cost spread component the transitory spread component 
because price changes associated with this component are transitory.  Transitory price changes 
regularly reverse.  Price changes caused by a jump from the bid to the ask most frequently follow 
price changes caused by a jump from the ask to the bid.  Such price changes occur when the 
order flow includes a mix of buyers and sellers.   
Traders call the bouncing back and forth between bid and ask prices bid/ask bounce.  Bid/ask 
bounce is a minor form of price volatility caused by impatient traders who demand immediacy.  
The transitory spread component is responsible for bid/ask bounce. 
14.2.2 The Adverse Selection Spread Component  
Since dealers do not know fundamental values well, they expose themselves to adverse selection 
from better-informed traders when they offer liquidity.  The better-informed traders choose 
which side of the market on which to trade, and the dealers end up losing money to them.  When 
some traders are better informed than are other traders, traders are asymmetrically informed.   
If dealers set their spreads to reflect only their normal costs of doing business, their losses to 
well-informed traders would eventually force them out of business.  Dealers must widen their 
spreads further to cover their losses to informed traders.  This additional widening of the spread

Chapter 15 
Block Traders 
Block trades result from orders that are too large to fill easily using standard trading procedures.  
Such orders generally demand more liquidity than is normally available at exchanges or in dealer 
networks.  Traders who wish to trade large blocks therefore must look elsewhere for liquidity.  
They usually turn to block traders to arrange their trades. 
Block traders include block dealers and block brokers.  Block dealers arrange block trades when 
they fill their clients’ large orders.  Block brokers arrange block trades when they find other 
traders who are willing to fill their clients’ orders.  Both types of block traders usually arrange 
their trades by telephone in the upstairs block market.  The traders who initiate large trades are 
block initiators.  We will call the traders who fill their orders block liquidity suppliers.  Block 
liquidity suppliers include dealers and large buy side traders.  
Although block trades represent a small fraction of all trades in most markets, they often account 
for much of the total trading volume due to their large sizes.  Block traders arrange most block 
trades on behalf of large institutions and very wealthy individuals. 
Large traders often have a significant impact on prices.  They therefore must very carefully 
arrange their trades to control their transaction costs.  Block traders must especially consider how 
they expose their orders to avoid losing to front runners and quote matchers. 
Since block trades significantly affect volumes and prices, traders must understand block trading 
to interpret volumes and prices.  If you intend to extract information from volumes and prices, 
you must understand block trading.  
In this chapter, you will learn how large traders expose their orders, and how block traders 
arrange their trades.  You will learn that block dealers and block brokers only want to serve 
uninformed clients who honestly tell them the true sizes of their orders.  Block initiators—
whether they are uninformed or informed, honest or deceitful —therefore must convince block 
liquidity suppliers that they are uninformed and honest.  We therefore will consider how traders 
convince others that they are uninformed and honest.  
15.1 Statistical Definitions of Block Trades 
For our purposes, a block trade is any trade that results from an order that is too large to fill 
easily using normal trading procedures.  Such orders typically represent more than a day’s 
normal trading volume.  In thinly traded instruments, these orders may only represent a few 
thousand shares or tens of contracts.  In actively traded instruments, such orders are many times 
larger.  Most block traders think of a block as exceeding a quarter of a day’s average trading 
volume in an actively trade stock.   
For statistical purposes, exchanges often arbitrarily designate trades as block trades if they 
exceed some fixed size.  These classification schemes vary by exchange.  The New York Stock 
Exchange defines a block trade as 10,000 shares or more, regardless of trading activity or price 
level.  Traders, however, routinely arrange such trades on the Exchange floor in actively traded 
stocks and in low priced stocks.  Although officially classified as block trades, these trades are 
normal trades in all other respects.  In thinly traded stocks, or in very high priced stocks like

Berkshire Hathaway (priced as of this writing above 70,000 dollars per share), trades smaller 
than 10,000 shares often cannot easily be arranged on the floor of the Exchange.   
A Humble Suggestion 
Block trading statistics would be more useful if block trades were classified by whether they 
exceed some fraction of average daily volume rather than by whether they exceed some fixed 
size. 
 
15.2 Block Trading Problems 
Block initiators face four problems when they attempt to arrange their traders.  The latent 
demand problem makes it hard to find block liquidity suppliers who are not in the market.  The 
order exposure problem makes block initiators reluctant to advertise for liquidity for fear driving 
the market away from them.  The price discrimination problem makes liquidity suppliers 
reluctant to trade with large traders because they fear that more size will follow.  The asymmetric 
information problem makes liquidity suppliers reluctant to trade with block initiators because 
they fear that the block initiators are well informed. 
15.2.1 The Latent Demand Problem 
The most obvious problem that large traders face is finding traders to with whom to trade.  Many 
block liquidity suppliers are unwilling to expose their interest.  Many more might trade if asked, 
but they have not yet issued orders to trade.  Block traders must find these traders to complete 
their trades.  
Traders who would be willing to trade if asked, but who have not yet issued trading orders, have 
latent trading demands.  They may not issue orders because writing orders is costly, or because 
they simply do not realize that they are willing to trade. 
When the probability of trading is small, traders often do not issue orders because they are costly 
to manage.  For example, a trader may be a willing buyer of hundreds of different stocks at 
prices 5 percent below their current market prices.  If he creates and submits orders for each 
stock, he risks buying all the stocks should the market as a whole drop significantly.  Since he 
cannot afford to buy all the stocks, he cannot allow so many orders to stand at once.  Moreover, 
if all stocks drop together, he may not be a willing buyer in any stock.  He therefore waits to see 
which stocks drop.  He has latent trading demands for many stocks, but block traders must 
discover them before he will trade. 
Other traders simply do not know that they are willing to trade.  Forming opinions about 
thousands of securities is costly.  Instead, they often wait until events force them to think about 
trading opportunities.  When presented with an attractive opportunity, they may then decide to 
trade. 
Traders who are willing to trade but who do not initiate their trades are responsive traders.  They 
respond to demands for liquidity.  Most traders who supply liquidity are responsive traders.  
Block traders must discover the latent demands of responsive traders when they cannot find 
adequate liquidity in the market.  They find liquidity primarily by calling traders who they think 
would be willing trade.

15-3 
Block traders also often move prices significantly to discover the latent demands of responsive 
traders.  Buyers bid prices up, and sellers offer prices down to encourage responsive traders to 
pay attention and respond.  Block initiators give price concessions to block liquidity suppliers to 
encourage them to trade.  
Good block traders know where to look for traders willing to provide liquidity at the lowest cost.  
They keep track of who is interested in various securities, and who has traded those securities in 
the past.  They also try to know what instruments will appeal to different traders so that they can 
predict who will be most willing to trade when presented with attractive trading opportunities. 
Hard Work Pays 
Suppose that brokers can develop and maintain one buy side trader client for each hour per week 
that he works.  A broker who works only 20 hours per week has 190 ways to arrange trades 
among pairs of his 20 clients.  If the broker works an additional 20 hours a week, he has 780 
ways to arrange trades.  If he works 60 hours a week, he can arrange trades 1,770 ways.   
This illustration shows that well organized brokers become more productive the harder they 
work.  Hard working brokers benefit from the network externality.   
 
Most large traders do not know as much about latent demands as do professional block traders 
who specialize in collecting this information.  Large traders therefore often contract with block 
traders to arrange their trades. 
Large traders do not initiate all block trades.  Sometimes sales traders in large wire houses 
broker block trades by identifying latent trading demands on both sides of the trade.   
Block Traders Play Concentration Well 
Block traders play a game similar to the card game “concentration” in which players take turns 
uncovering cards two at a time and attempt to match them.  To match buyers to sellers, block 
traders must remember who was, who is, and—most importantly—who would be interested in 
trading hundreds of securities.   
Unlike card players, block traders can take notes, and they obviously do not have to take turns 
when playing.  Not surprisingly, good block traders spend most of their time on the telephone.  
Many enter copious notes into electronic contract management systems. 
 
15.2.2 The Order Exposure Problem 
When looking for liquidity, block traders must be very careful about to whom they expose their 
orders.  Traders who know about impending blocks often use that information when trading to 
the disadvantage of the block traders.  Some traders create orders expressly to front run pending 
blocks.  Other traders who intend to trade on the same side as the block accelerate their trading to 
avoid the price impact of the block.  Traders who intend to trade on the opposite side retard their 
trading to capitalize on the price impact of the block.  These strategies accelerate the price 
impact of the block by demanding liquidity in front of the block, or by withholding liquidity 
from the block.  Block traders then ultimately obtain less favorable prices for their blocks.  To

Chapter 16 
Value Traders 
Value traders are speculators who form opinions about instrument values using all information 
available to them.  They buy instruments that they believe are undervalued and sell instruments 
that they believe are overvalued.  We describe their speculative trading strategies in Chapter 10 
where we discuss informed traders.  
Value traders are also liquidity providers, though they often do not see themselves this way.  
This chapter explains how and when value traders offer liquidity.  We shall see that they are the 
ultimate suppliers of market liquidity.  They trade when no one else will.  We therefore must 
understand this aspect of value trading to fully understand who makes markets liquid.  
Value traders who understand that they liquidity supply will trade more successfully than will 
those who do not realize that they are liquidity suppliers.  By considering the implications of 
their roles as liquidity suppliers, value traders will make better decisions about when to trade and 
at what price to trade.  If you are interested in being a value trader, the principles discussed in 
this chapter will be of particular interest to you.  
Dealers often trade with value traders when they want to restore their target inventories.  Dealers 
therefore have mixed feelings about value traders.  On the one hand, they compete with them to 
provide liquidity.  On the other hand, they depend upon them for liquidity when they are 
unwilling to carry large inventory positions.  If you are a dealer or if you are interested in being a 
dealer, you need to thoroughly understand how dealers relate to value traders.  
Value traders must confront an economic problem called the winner’s curse to trade successfully.  
Traders suffer the winner’s curse when they win an auction and subsequently regret that they 
traded because they paid too much or sold for too little.  Everyone who competes with others to 
buy or sell items faces the winner’s curse.  You need to know about the winner’s curse when you 
buy a house, when you trade on eBay, and when you bid on a job.  Even if you do not intend to 
trade securities or contracts, you should find this chapter useful. 
16.1 Value Traders Supply Liquidity 
Although value traders trade to make speculative profits, the effect of their trading is to provide 
liquidity to the market.  This characterization of their trading is apparent when you consider 
when they trade profitably.   
Value trading is profitable only when price differs from fundamental value.  Price can differ 
from fundamental value two ways: 
• When new information causes fundamental value to change and thereby deviate from price, 
or  
• When uninformed traders push price away from fundamental value.   
In the first case, news traders profit because—by definition—they are the first to receive new 
information.  Their trading tends to push price to the new fundamental value.  (Chapter 10 
discusses information flow trading.)  In the second case, value traders profit.  Through their 
research, they are able to determine that price no longer reflects fundamental value.  Their

trading tends to push price back to its fundamental value.  Value trading therefore is profitable 
only when value traders trade in response to demands for liquidity made by uninformed traders.   
In the following discussion, we will need to refer frequently to “the uninformed traders whose 
demands for liquidity cause prices to change.”  To simply our discussion, we will simply call 
them the uninformed liquidity demanders.  The uninformed liquidity demanders may be one or 
more large traders, or they may be numerous small traders who all want to trade on the same side 
of the market.  They cause prices to change as they try to fill their orders.  
16.1.1 Uninformed Traders Cause Prices to Deviate from Fundamental Values  
Price deviates from fundamental value when uninformed traders demand liquidity, and when the 
traders who offer them liquidity do not realize that they are uninformed.  This situation often 
happens when dealers do not know their clients well.  To protect themselves from adverse 
selection losses to informed traders, dealers must make inferences from their order flow.  If 
uninformed traders dominate the order flow on the same side of the market, dealers will mistake 
those traders for informed traders and adjust prices accordingly.  These price adjustments cause 
price to deviate from fundamental value.  
Dealers also may adjust prices even when they know that their clients are uninformed.  When 
dealers supply liquidity only on one side of the market, their inventories diverge from their target 
levels.  The resulting off-target inventories expose them to substantial inventory risks.  If their 
uninformed clients demand more liquidity than dealers are willing to supply, dealers will demand 
substantial price concessions to bear the resulting inventory risk.  These price adjustments will 
be especially large when dealers fear that they will not easily find traders on the other side of the 
market.   
Uninformed traders may also cause prices to deviate from fundamental values in order-driven 
markets that do not have dealers.  In such markets, prices change when traders demand liquidity 
on one side of the market and exhaust the liquidity supplied there.   
16.1.2 How Value Traders Respond 
Value traders may trade directly with the uninformed liquidity demanders, or they may trade 
indirectly with them through the intermediation of dealers and other traders who employ dealing 
strategies.  Value traders trade directly with them when value traders offer limit orders that the 
uninformed liquidity demanders take, or when block brokers ask value traders to fill orders for 
their uninformed liquidity demanding clients.  In these situations, value traders supply 
immediacy to the uninformed liquidity demanders because they allow them to trade when they 
want to trade. 
Value traders also indirectly supply liquidity to the uninformed liquidity demanders.  We can 
best introduce this situation with an example.   
Suppose that uninformed liquidity demanders want to sell stock in a hurry.  They sell to dealers 
who offer them immediacy.  The dealers accumulate large long positions as they buy the 
inventory.  Since they do not know their clients very well, they suspect that the uninformed 
liquidity demanders may be informed traders.  The dealers therefore adjust their prices 
accordingly.  They also adjust their prices because they fear that they will not easily find traders 
on the other side of the market, in which case they will be exposed to more inventory risk than

16-3 
they would like to bear.  These adjustments cause price to fall below fundamental value so that 
value trading becomes profitable.  To restore their target inventories, the dealers lower their 
quotes.  Value traders buy from the dealers at their ask prices when they see that they can buy 
substantial size at discounted prices. 
The dealers solicit liquidity from the value traders by lowering their asking prices.  When the 
value traders respond, they take liquidity from the dealers in the form of immediacy, but 
simultaneously supply liquidity to the dealers in the form of size or depth.  In effect, the value 
traders indirectly supply liquidity to the uninformed liquidity suppliers through the 
intermediation of the dealers. 
Even though the dealers lay off their inventory on the value traders, both sets of traders may 
profit.  The dealers will profit if they sell their inventories at prices above the prices that they 
paid to the uninformed liquidity demanders.  The value traders will profit when prices return to 
fundamental values. 
16.1.3 Market Resiliency 
When uninformed traders cannot change prices substantially, the market is resilient to their 
trading.  Value traders make markets resilient by standing ready to trade when prices more away 
from fundamental values.   
Dealers will take larger positions when trading with their uninformed clients in resilient markets 
than in markets that lack resiliency.  In resilient markets, dealers know that they can rely upon 
value traders to restore their target inventories if their order flows remain unbalanced. 
16.2 The Outside Spread and its Determinants 
The prices at which a value trader is willing to trade define the value trader’s outside spread.  
Since value traders are well-informed traders, they rarely quote these prices.  They do not want 
to reveal their value estimates, and they do not want to give free trading options to the market. 
The spreads of value traders depend on the risks and costs of their business.  When they are 
large, their spreads will be large.  This section considers what determines the outside spread. 
16.2.1 The Risks of Value Trading 
Value traders face two serious risks when they trade.  These are adverse selection and the 
winner’s curse.  Like dealers, value traders face adverse selection when they supply liquidity to 
better-informed traders.  They face the winner’s curse when they have misestimated instrument 
values.   
The two risks are closely related.  Both arise when value traders are not fully informed.  When 
they suffer adverse selection, they lack information that better-informed traders have.  When 
they suffer the winner’s curse, they have mistakenly valued their instruments.  
16.2.2 The Adverse Selection Risk 
Value traders are subject to adverse selection risk because they offer liquidity in response to 
other traders who demand it.  They must be particularly careful that they do not trade with news 
traders who have new information that the value traders do not have.

Chapter 17 
Arbitrage 
Arbitrageurs are speculators who trade on information about relative values.  They buy 
instruments that seem relatively cheap and sell those that seem relatively expensive.  
Arbitrageurs profit when prices converge so that their purchases appreciate relative to their sales.   
We introduced arbitrage trading strategies when we examined informed traders in Chapter 10.  
There we described how arbitrageurs acquire information about relative values, how the price 
impacts of their trades cause prices to converge, and how they thereby unwittingly enforce the 
law of one price.  This price characterization of arbitrage helps us understand how arbitrageurs 
trade as informed traders.   
This chapter continues our study of arbitrageurs.  Besides being informed traders, we shall see 
that arbitrageurs also supply liquidity, move liquidity, and produce financial products.  This 
quantity characterization of arbitrage helps explain why arbitrage opportunities arise.  
Successful arbitrageurs must understand both the price and quantity characterizations of 
arbitrage.  Although many arbitrageurs can trade successfully merely by responding to arbitrage 
opportunities as they arise, arbitrage is more profitable when arbitrageurs also can predict when 
and where those opportunities will arise.  Arbitrageurs who consider the quantity characteristics 
of their arbitrages will make better decisions about when and at what prices to trade.   
This chapter characterizes different types of arbitrages and discusses the risks that arbitrageurs 
face.  If you intend to be an arbitrageur or if you trade with arbitrageurs, this discussion should 
greatly interest you.   
We shall see that arbitrageurs sometimes compete with dealers to offer liquidity.  Dealers also 
often lose to arbitrageurs because arbitrageurs usually are better-informed traders.  If you intend 
to be a dealer, you must understand how arbitrageurs can hurt your business.  If you merely wish 
to understand the origins of market liquidity, you also must understand what arbitrageurs do. 
In Chapter 26 (Competition within and among Markets), we show that arbitrage is one of three 
processes that keep fragmented markets together.  If you are interested in how markets compete 
with each other to trade similar or identical instruments, you must thoroughly understand why 
arbitrageurs trade.  You must particularly understand arbitrage to estimate the costs of 
competition among marketplaces.   
Commentators sometimes blame arbitrageurs when markets crash.  For example, some people 
believe that index arbitrageurs were at least partly responsible for the 1987 Stock Market Crash.  
To understand how traders transmit volatility among markets, you must consider what 
arbitrageurs do. 
Complaints about arbitrage have led to restrictions upon arbitrage trading strategies in some 
markets.  These restrictions can be costly because arbitrage trading benefits more than just 
arbitragers.  It also benefits other traders and the economy as a whole.  To estimate the 
sometimes-significant costs of arbitrage restrictions, you must appreciate the quantity 
characteristics of arbitrage.

Our presentation starts with some definitions.  We then characterize arbitrage so that we can 
understand it in light of trading strategies that we have already discussed.  Next, we introduce 
and discuss various types of arbitrages.  We follow this section with discussions about the risks 
of arbitrage and about how arbitrageurs control these risks.  We conclude the chapter with 
discussions about the quantity characteristics of arbitrage and about how dealers and arbitrageurs 
relate to each other.  
17.1 Definitions 
Arbitrageurs trade instruments whose prices are correlated.  Correlated prices tend to rise or fall 
together.  Instruments typically have correlated prices when their values depend on common 
fundamental factors.  They also may have correlated prices when the demands of uninformed 
traders to buy or sell the instruments are correlated.   
Arbitrageurs form opinions about the normal relations among correlated instruments.  An 
arbitrage opportunity arises when the prices of correlated instruments diverge from their normal 
relations.  Arbitrageurs then buy those instruments that have become relatively cheap and sell 
those that have become relatively expensive.  The strategy is profitable if the prices of the 
instruments return to their normal relations.  When that happens, the prices have converged.  
Arbitrageurs profit from price convergence.   
Barter, Arbitrage, and Relative Values 
Modern economies use money as a medium of exchange.  Almost all trades involve money.  The 
buyer pays it, and the seller receives it.  When a trader wants to dispose of one item and acquire 
another, the trader usually sells the first and buys the second.  The nice thing about money is that 
it allows us to buy and sell from different people.   
Barter involves the exchange of two (or more) items without the use of money.  Barter is not 
common because both traders must be interested in both items.  Traders who want to exchange 
apples for oranges often cannot easily find traders willing to exchange oranges for apples.   
Trades involving money can be considered special cases of barter in which one of the traded 
items is money.  This characterization of trading reminds us that all trades are relative value 
trades.  People buy things when they value the item more than the money they exchange for it.  
They sell things when they value the money more than the item.  In a sense, all trades are 
arbitrages since all trades are relative value trades. 
 
When arbitrageurs take arbitrage positions, they put on the arbitrage.  When they close their 
positions, they unwind their positions or take off the arbitrage.  Arbitrageurs usually unwind 
their positions when the arbitrage converges.  Since prices may again diverge after they 
converge, arbitrageurs need to closely watch their positions so that they can close them at 
favorable prices.   
The portfolios that arbitrageurs construct are their hedge portfolios.  The various positions in the 
hedge portfolio are the legs of the arbitrage.   
Hedge portfolios usually consist of one or more long positions and one or more short positions in 
various correlated instruments.  Arbitrageurs generally construct hedge portfolios to minimize 
the total risk of the portfolio given some measure of its size.

(In some instances, hedge portfolios may consist only of short positions or only of long 
positions.  Traders construct such hedge portfolios of instruments whose returns are inversely 
correlated.  Such portfolios typically include put contracts.  For example, a long position in a 
deep-in-the-money put contract is a good hedge for a long position in the underling instrument.)  
Traders usually identify one leg of the hedge portfolio as the arbitrage numerator or reference 
instrument.  They use the numerator to measure the size of the portfolio.  The arbitrage 
numerator is usually the security, contract, or commodity that traders most closely identify with 
the common risk factor that causes the correlations among the various instruments in the hedge 
portfolio.  The arbitrage numerator for hedge portfolios involving a derivative contract and its 
underlying cash instrument is usually the cash instrument.   
The ratios of holdings in other legs to holdings in the numerator are the portfolio hedge ratios.  
Traders choose their hedge ratios to minimize the total risk of the portfolio.   
Arbitrageurs may have long or short positions in the hedge portfolio.  They are long the hedge 
portfolio when they have a long position in the instrument that serves as the arbitrage numerator.  
Since hedge portfolios usually have both long and short positions, a long hedge portfolio will 
have one or more short positions.  A short hedge portfolio will likewise have one or more long 
positions.  
Hedge portfolios have carrying costs.  Carrying costs are the costs of holding a hedge portfolio.  
Depending on the arbitrage, these costs may include interest paid or foregone to finance 
positions in the hedge portfolio, dividends paid on short positions, fees paid to physically store 
commodities, or depreciation incurred as commodities age and spoil.  Carrying costs are 
sometimes offset by dividends, interest income, and lending fees earned on long positions, or by 
interest earned on the proceeds from short sales.  Carrying costs can make some arbitrages very 
expensive. 
The difference in prices between instruments in the hedge portfolio is the basis.  The fair value 
of the basis is the basis that would result if all instruments were correctly priced relative to each 
other.  Fair values depend on carrying costs.  Arbitrageurs must estimate fair values because they 
usually are not common knowledge. 
The arbitrage spread is the difference between the basis and the fair value of the basis.  
Arbitrageurs trade when the arbitrage spread is sufficiently large.   
The values of the basis at which arbitrageurs are just willing to trade are called arbitrage bounds.  
The arbitrage bounds are on either side of fair value.  Arbitrageurs generally put on their 
arbitrages only when the basis is outside of the arbitrage bounds. 
Hedge portfolios generally are less risky than the positions in the individual instruments from 
which arbitrageurs construct them.  The reduction in risk is due to the offsetting effects of having 
long and short positions in instruments whose values depend on the same factors.  When changes 
in these factors cause instrument values to fall, gains in the short positions offset losses in the 
long positions.  Likewise, when changes in these factors cause instrument values to rise, gains in 
the long positions offset losses in the short positions.   
The risk that an arbitrage hedge portfolio will lose value is called basis risk.  Analysts also call 
this risk residual risk because it remains after the common factor risks in the various portfolio 
instruments cancel each other.  Basis risk arises because prices depend on instrument-specific 
factors as well as common factors.  The specific factors may be fundamental valuation factors, or

Chapter 18 
Buy Side Traders 
Traders must pay close attention to their order submission strategies to trade effectively.  Traders 
who optimize their trading strategies will have lower transaction costs and higher portfolio 
returns than those who do not carefully consider their trading problems.   
Order submission strategy is the most important determinant of execution quality that traders 
control.  Traders must decide when to submit market orders and when to submit limit orders.  
When they submit limit orders, they must know where to place their limit prices.  If their limit 
orders do not execute, they must know when, and how, to resubmit their orders.   
Large traders also must pay close attention to how they display their orders.  Traders who display 
large orders often attract front runners and scare away liquidity suppliers.  Large traders 
therefore must consider the following questions:  
• Whether to actively look for the other side or to wait for it to come to them. 
• Whether to show their full interest or to hide it. 
• Whether to break up their orders and spread them over time or to bring their whole orders to 
market at once. 
• Whether to employ a single broker or to use multiple brokers to hide their total interest.   
• Whether to trade in one market or in many markets.  
Display decisions are the most important trading decisions that large buy side traders make.   
The decision to use limit orders versus market orders is related to the order display decision.  
Traders who want to display their trading interest often use limit orders to show that they are 
willing to trade.  Those who do not want to show their interest often use market orders.  Traders 
do not have to display their limit orders, however.  They often can use the services of a 
confidential broker, or they can submit their orders to electronic trading systems that permit 
undisclosed limit orders. 
The strategies that traders should use depend on their trading problems.  Informed traders who 
have material information that will soon become public will trade very differently from value 
traders who can identify mispriced instruments.  Both types of traders will trade differently from 
traders who need to raise cash before a deadline or index traders who need to rebalance their 
index portfolios in response to changes in the composition of their target indexes. 
In this chapter, we examine the issues buy side traders weigh when deciding how to trade.  We 
start by considering the decision to use market orders versus limit orders.  We then analyze the 
benefits and costs of exposure and consider how traders can defend against parasitic trading 
strategies that order anticipators may exercise against them.  Finally, we discuss how exchanges, 
brokers, and regulators can structure markets to promote the interests of buy side traders. 
Although these issues obviously interest buy side traders, they also should interest anyone who 
wants to understand the origins of liquidity.  Order submission strategies affect the supply and 
demand of liquidity.  Traders demand liquidity when they submit market orders, and they supply

liquidity when they submit limit orders.  We therefore must consider how traders choose their 
order submission strategies to fully understand liquidity. 
Chapters 4 (Orders and Order Properties), 7 (Brokers), 11 (Order Anticipators), 12 (Bluffers and 
Market Manipulation), 14 (Bid/Ask Spreads), and 15 (Block Traders) introduce many of the 
issues discussed in this chapter.  The value-added in this chapter comes from the discussion of 
these issues from the point of view of the buy side trader.  To avoid unnecessary duplication, the 
text in this chapter assumes some familiarity with some of these issues.  Readers who are not 
familiar with the markets may want to read these other chapters first.  
18.1 Market versus Limit Orders 
The equilibrium spread model presented in Chapter 14 (Bid/Ask Spreads) shows that order 
submission strategy does not matter when all traders have identical needs.  Bid/ask spreads 
simply adjust to ensure that traders are indifferent between using market orders and limit orders.  
In practice, however, traders are not identical.  Some traders need to trade faster than do other 
traders.  Impatient traders generally should use market orders while patient traders should use 
limit orders.  Some traders are also more sensitive to order exposure issues than are other traders.  
Those who do not want to display often use market orders to avoid exposing limit orders.  
In all cases, the decision to use limit orders or market orders depends critically on the bid/ask 
spread.  When the spread is wide, taking liquidity is expensive and offering liquidity is attractive.  
When the spread is narrow, market orders are attractive relative to limit orders.  Traders judge 
whether spreads are wide or narrow from their experience in the market.  They can much better 
organize that experience by being familiar with the bid/ask spread determinants discussed in 
Chapter 14 (Bid/Ask Spreads). 
A Problem with Rules 
The rule to take liquidity when the spread is small and offer it when the spread is large is valid 
only when you do not know anything about value.  For example, suppose that the market is 48 
bid, offered at 50.  If the spread normally is 10, market orders would appear to be extremely 
attractive relative to limit orders.   
Now suppose that you knew that the true value of the instrument is 45.  A market order sell order 
would execute at a great price relative to value, but a market buy order would execute at a poor 
price.  
This situation often arises when an impatient limit order trader places an aggressively priced 
order in the market.  For example, suppose that the market was 40 bid, offered at 50, before an 
aggressive buyer placed a limit buy order at 48.  The limit order buyer improves the market 
substantially for market order sellers, but provides no benefit to market order buyers.  Sellers 
who can recognize this situation should take liquidity.   
The new bid also affects the decisions buyers make to offer or take liquidity.  Since the new bid 
decreases the probability that limit orders placed below 48 will ultimately execute, limit order 
strategies that would otherwise place buy orders below 48 are less attractive.  The new bid makes 
market orders more attractive to buyers, though not nearly as much as the abnormally narrow 
spread would suggest.

18-3 
The rule is correct when traders know nothing about values.  In our example, sellers benefit 
greatly if they use market orders rather than limit orders, and buyers may be slightly better off 
with market orders than limit orders.  The narrow spread makes market orders more attractive 
than limit orders—on average—to uninformed traders.  
 
The prices at which traders place their limit orders depend on how they value the tradeoff 
between execution price and execution probability.  Aggressively priced orders will more likely 
execute than will less aggressively priced orders, but the execution prices will be inferior.  
Traders who are more concerned about price than about trading will more likely use limit orders.  
Traders who are more concerned about trading than price will more likely use market orders.  
The decision to use market orders versus limit orders also depends on what will happen when 
limit orders do not execute.  Traders who must fill their orders will trade at inferior prices when 
the market moves away from their limit orders.  They can reduce their exposure to this risk by 
using market orders or by placing their limit orders close to the market to increase the probability 
that they will execute quickly.  Traders who are not committed to trading only trade if they can 
obtain a good price.  These traders—primarily traders who employ dealing strategies—often use 
limit orders or firm quotes to profit from the bid/ask spread.  When their limit orders do not 
execute, they simply cancel them or replace them with orders placed at new prices. 
To derive optimal trading strategies, traders must know how execution probabilities depend on 
limit order prices.  The relation between these variables depends on market conditions.  The most 
important factors include total limit order size at better prices, price volatility, and trader interest 
in the instrument.   
Traders can acquire information about the relation between execution probabilities and limit 
order prices using formal econometric models.  Numerous vendors sell access to optimized order 
generators that suggest order strategies based on current market conditions.   
Traders also acquire information about the relation between execution probabilities and limit 
order prices through experience.  Experienced traders who pay close attention to the market get a 
feel for what may happen.  Buy side traders who give their brokers market-not-held orders give 
them timing discretion over their orders.  They expect that their brokers will use their experience 
and knowledge of current market conditions to determine the best strategies for filling their 
orders and to continuously revaluate those strategies as conditions change. 
18.2 The Order Exposure Decision 
Traders expose their intentions many different ways.  On one extreme, traders can publicize their 
trading interests by submitting limit orders to systems that widely display their orders.  They then 
hope that other traders will trade with them.  On the other extreme, traders can hide their 
interests until an exchange or a broker presents an acceptable opportunity to trade.  Traders may 
also trade only through brokers and exchanges that settle their trades on an anonymous basis so 
that neither side knows with whom they traded.  A multitude of order exposure strategies lies 
between these two extremes.  
Traders decide to expose by weighing the benefits of display against the costs of display.  The 
benefits are obvious.  Buyers and sellers can find each other most easily when they both show 
that they want to trade.  This simple observation helps explain why trading tends to consolidate

Part V 
Origins of Liquidity and Volatility  
 
In the next two chapters, we provide broad characterizations of liquidity and of volatility.  These 
concepts mean different things to different people.  Consequently, people often are confused 
when they discuss them.  The discussions in these chapters should give you a much more 
complete understanding of the origins of liquidity and volatility, and of their many dimensions.  
Chapter 19 explains that liquidity is the successful outcome of a bilateral search in which buyers 
look for sellers and sellers look for buyers.  This characterization of liquidity explains why 
liquidity has multiple attributes.  The chapter concludes by showing how various types of traders 
cooperate and compete with each other to supply liquidity.  
Chapter 20 breaks total volatility into fundamental and transitory volatility components.  
Transitory volatility is closely related to the transaction costs that uninformed traders bear.  
Regulators therefore are quite interested in it.  The chapter concludes with a discussion about 
how statisticians can discriminate between the two volatility components.

Chapter 19 
Liquidity 
Liquidity is the ability to trade large size quickly at low cost when you want to trade.  It is the 
most important characteristic of well-functioning markets.   
Everyone likes liquidity.  Traders like liquidity because it allows them to cheaply implement 
their trading strategies.  Exchanges like liquidity because it attracts traders to their markets.  
Regulators like liquidity because liquid markets are often less volatile than illiquid markets.  
Market Frictions 
Economists like liquid markets—security markets, contract markets, product markets, and labor 
markets—because their models work better when they do not have to consider how transaction 
costs affect economic decisions.  When confronted with transaction costs, people trade less often.  
If the costs are high enough, they do not trade at all.   
Transaction costs in an economic system therefore are like frictions in a mechanical system.  
They both slow things down and can ultimately stop all activity.  Economists therefore call 
transaction costs market frictions. 
 
Everyone in the markets has some affect on liquidity.  Impatient traders take liquidity.  Dealers, 
limit order traders, and some speculators offer liquidity.  Brokers and exchanges organize 
liquidity.   
Given its importance, you would expect that the term liquidity would be well defined and 
universally understood.  In fact, liquidity means different things to different people.  Traders and 
regulators talk about it all the time, but rarely are they clear about what they mean.  
Consequently, they often fail to communicate effectively about liquidity.   
The confusion is due to the many dimensions of liquidity.  When people think about liquidity, 
they may think about trading quickly, about trading large size, or about trading at low cost.  
Some dimensions of liquidity are more important to some people than to others.  Unfortunately, 
people rarely distinguish among these dimensions when discussing liquidity. 
In this chapter, you will see that liquidity—the ability to trade—is the object of a bilateral search 
in which buyers look for sellers and sellers look for buyers.  The various liquidity dimensions are 
related to each other through the mechanics of this bilateral search.  Traders must understand 
these relations to trade effectively.   
Understanding liquidity is one of the primary objectives of this book.  In this chapter, we will 
carefully define liquidity and its various dimensions.  We then will identify the various types of 
traders who supply liquidity and discuss how they compete with each other.   
These discussions will be especially useful to you if you are a trader who needs to know where to 
look for liquidity.  They also will be useful to you if you intend to offer liquidity.  In which case, 
you must understand with whom you will compete so that you can predict when you expect to be 
successful.

19-2 
You also need to understand liquidity to measure it effectively.  Many traders and regulators 
regularly measure liquidity.  Traders measure liquidity to determine whether their trading 
strategies are sensible given the available liquidity.  They also measure liquidity to evaluate the 
service they obtain from their brokers.  Brokers likewise measure liquidity to evaluate the service 
they obtain from their dealers.  Regulators measure liquidity to determine which market 
structures are best.  No one can answer these questions, however, without clearly understanding 
what they are measuring.  As a rule, you cannot measure something that you cannot define.  The 
concepts presented in this chapter provide a basis for the measurement methods presented in 
Chapter 21 (Measuring Liquidity). 
19.1 The Search for Liquidity 
Liquidity is the object of bilateral search.  In a bilateral search, buyers search for sellers, and 
sellers search for buyers.  When a buyer finds a seller who will trade at mutually acceptable 
terms, the buyer has found liquidity.  Likewise, when a seller finds a buyer who will trade at 
mutually acceptable terms, the seller has found liquidity.  To understand trading, you must 
understand the strategies traders use to conduct these bilateral searches. 
The Most Important Bilateral Search 
For many people, finding a life partner is the most important bilateral search problem that they 
encounter.  For others, it is finding a job.  Although this book is not about how people form life 
relationships and obtain jobs, all bilateral search problems have similar structures.  What you 
learn about how people trade securities and contracts may help you understand how people find 
partners and jobs.  
 
Bilateral searches are similar to—but more complicated than—unilateral searches.  You will find 
bilateral search strategies easier to understand if you first understand unilateral search strategies.   
19.1.1 Unilateral Searches 
In a unilateral search, you actively search for a good match—a good price, for example.  The 
main decision that you must make is when to stop the search.  The general rule is to continue 
searching as long as the expected benefit from an additional inquiry is greater than the expected 
cost of the inquiry.  The expected benefit depends on the probability that you will find a better 
match than you have already found.  As the search proceeds, this probability declines as you find 
progressively better matches.  The expected benefit also depends on how much better unfound 
matches might be than the best match you have already found.  As the search proceeds, the 
possible improvement declines as you find progressively better matches.  At some point, your 
expected benefit from an additional inquiry becomes less than the cost of the inquiry.  You then 
stop the search and pick the best match that you found.  
A Unilateral Search for a 35mm Camera 
Fred wants to buy a specific camera model at a low price.  His time is worth 30 dollars an hour.   
Fred goes onto the Internet to search for the best price among mail order photography stores that 
offer the camera.  After five minutes of searching at A1ePhoto’s site, he discovers that they will 
sell the camera for 112 dollars.  After another five minutes, he discovers that BNDPicture will

19-3 
sell it for 109 dollars.  He decides to search again.  Six minutes later, he finds that CDBirD will 
sell it for 119 dollars.  No bargain there.   
Should Fred search more?  He estimates that if he finds a lower price, it would be no lower than 
99 dollars, i.e., no more than 10 dollars less than his current best price.  He also estimates that the 
probability that he will find a price that low at less than 0.25.  Fred’s expected gain from 
searching again therefore is less than 2.50 dollars (10 × 0.25).  Since it appears that each search 
takes at least five minutes, his expected cost of searching again is more than 2.50 dollars, given 
the 30-dollar value he places on an hour of his time.  Since the expected cost is greater than the 
expected gain, Fred decides to stop searching.  He buys the camera from BNDPicture for 109 
dollars.   
 
If searching is expensive, you will often stop before you have found the best possible match.  
You may later discover that you could have arranged a better match had you known more about 
the alternatives.  An optimal search produces the best possible result only if you are lucky 
enough to find it.  
The Economics of Divorce  
Some people divorce because they learn that they have arranged poor matches.  They either learn 
that their relationships did not develop as they expected, or that their opportunities to form other 
relationships were better than they expected.   
Other people divorce because they are not mature enough to accept that even when they search 
optimally, they generally will not arrange perfect matches.  When they later see other matches 
that they believe would have been better for them, they forget that they stopped searching 
because it was too costly.  They also forget that the search for a spouse is a bilateral search.  In 
particular, they forget that they cannot arrange every match that they might want to arrange. 
In either event, people who initiate divorces presumably believe that the benefits from searching 
again, or from being single, are greater than the substantial emotional, social, and financial costs 
of breaking their matches.  Unfortunately, many subsequently learn that their expectations were 
poorly founded.  
 
If you knew ahead of time where to find the best possible match, you would of course go there 
first.  In which case, the costs of searching would be very low because you already know the 
outcome.  In general, you will get a better outcome when your costs of searching are low. 
Exchanges Are Search Engines 
A search engine is a system that collects information in which people may be interested.  It 
allows people to search through that information at a low cost.   
In the previous example, had Fred been able to use a search engine to locate the best price for his 
camera, he might have discovered that GR8 Film and Photo is offering the camera for 87 dollars.  
Search engines make markets more competitive by lowering the costs of searching. 
Exchanges and electronic quotation services collect information about who wants to trade.  They 
then organize it so that traders can easily find the best trading opportunities.  They are search

Chapter 20 
Volatility 
Volatility is the tendency for prices to unexpectedly change.  Prices change in response to new 
information about values and in response to the demands of impatient traders for liquidity. 
Volatility itself changes through time.  Sometimes prices are very volatile.  Other times, prices 
are very stable and hardly change at all.  Large price changes sometimes occur in short time 
intervals.  Regulators and traders refer to episodes of such price changes as episodic volatility.  
Episodic volatility concerns many people because it can be quite scary.   
Volatility, risk, and profit are closely related.  Every drop in prices creates losses for traders who 
have long positions and profits for traders with short positions.  Likewise, every price rise causes 
losses for traders with short positions and profits for traders with long positions.  Traders 
therefore are very interested in volatility because it can have a significant impact on their wealth.  
If risk scares you or profits interest you, you need to know about volatility. 
Volatility especially concerns options traders.  Option contract values depend critically on the 
volatility of the underlying instrument.  Options traders must be able to measure and predict 
volatilities to trade profitably.  Both skills require that they understand well the origins of 
volatility.   
Technical traders who try to interpret trading volumes also pay close attention to volatility 
because volumes and volatility are often correlated.  The relation between the two variables is 
not simple, however.  It depends on the origins of the volatility.  
Volatility greatly concerns regulators.  Excessive volatility may indicate that markets are not 
functioning well.  Since accurate prices are extremely important in the economy, regulators pay 
close attention to the markets when prices are highly volatile.  They are especially attentive when 
markets crash. 
In this chapter, we identify the origins of volatility and distinguish between its two types.  
Fundamental volatility is due to unanticipated changes in instrument values while transitory 
volatility is due to trading activity by uninformed traders.   
The distinction is important both for traders and for regulators.  Traders must distinguish 
between the two volatility types to accurately predict future volatility, the profitability of dealing 
strategies, and transaction costs.  Regulators must distinguish between them because they cannot 
have any lasting effect on fundamental volatility, but they often can substantially affect transitory 
volatility.  Depending on the policies regulators adopt, they may decrease or increase transitory 
volatility.   
We start this short chapter with discussions about the origins of the two types of volatility.  We 
then finish by considering how to distinguish between them.  Chapter 28 (Bubbles, Crashes, and 
Circuit Breakers) considers what regulators can do about volatility when it appears excessive to 
them.

20.1 Fundamental Volatility 
Since economies use prices to allocate resources, it is very important that prices reflect 
fundamental values.  Values change when the fundamental factors that determine them change.  
Prices therefore should change when people learn that fundamental factors have unexpectedly 
changed.  Such price changes contribute to fundamental volatility.  
When new information about changes in fundamental values is common knowledge, prices may 
change without any trading.  For example, suppose that an unexpected killer frost descends upon 
Florida overnight.  The morning news will undoubtedly report the event.  The next day, orange 
juice futures contracts will open at a much higher price than the last price of the previous trading 
day. 
When only a few people know new information about changes in fundamental values, prices 
generally will change on high trading volumes.  The well-informed traders will trade on their 
information.  The pressures their trades put on prices will cause prices to change to reflect the 
new fundamental values.   
Since informed traders generally hurt dealers, and since dealers generally do not know when they 
trade with informed traders, dealers try to infer information about fundamental values from their 
order flows.  The inferences that they make contribute to the adverse selection spread component 
introduced in Chapter 13 (Dealers).  Price changes due to the adverse selection spread 
component thus contribute to fundamental volatility.   
20.1.1 Fundamental Volatility Factors 
Any factor that determines the value of a trading instrument can cause the price of that 
instrument to change.  For a commodity, the most important factors are cash market supply and 
demand conditions.  Other important factors are interest rates and storage costs.  For a bond, the 
most important factors are interest rates and the credit quality of the issuer.  For a stock, the most 
important factors are quality of management, the values of the company’s resources and 
technologies, the supply and demand conditions in its product markets and in its input markets, 
and interest rates.  For currencies, the important valuation factors include national inflation rates, 
macroeconomic policies, and trade and capital flows.  Unexpected changes in any of these 
factors generate fundamental volatility in the instrument. 
20.1.2 Predictability 
Expected changes in fundamental factors generally do not change prices.  Informative prices 
usually fully incorporate all available information about future values.  Since people base their 
expectations on existing information, fully informative prices will already incorporate expected 
changes in fundamental factors.  When the expected event occurs, it is not surprising, and it 
therefore should not cause prices to change.  Only unexpected events cause fundamental price 
volatility.  Consequently, the identifying characteristic of fundamental volatility in fully 
informative prices is unpredictable price changes.  An unpredictable price process is called a 
random walk.  Chapter 10 (Informed Traders and Market Efficiency) provides a more complete 
explanation of the properties of fully informative prices.  
The one exception to this rule involves price changes that are necessary to compensate 
instrument holders for their carrying costs and for bearing risk.  For example, the prices of zero-

20-3 
coupon bonds creep upwards over time as they approach maturity.  Since they pay no interest, 
investors buy them at substantial discounts to their face values.  The creep in prices compensates 
them for the interest payments that they otherwise would have received had they invested in a 
straight bond.  These creeping price changes are fully predictable and therefore do not contribute 
to fundamental volatility.  Note, however, that if interest rates unexpectedly fall, the prices of 
zero-coupon bonds will immediately rise to reflect the new interest rates.  This unexpected price 
change would contribute to fundamental volatility.  
20.1.3 Storage Costs 
Commodities that are expensive to store are often quite volatile.  The high storage costs ensure 
that producers and distributors generally will not hold large inventories.  When demand exceeds 
supply, buyers can quickly deplete inventories.  Prices then spike up until new production can 
relieve the shortage.  Conversely, when inventories are large and new product will soon arrive, 
distributors may greatly discount the inventory to make room for the newly arrivals.   
Price volatility in high storage cost commodities depends on the time it takes to adjust the flow 
of product from the producers to the consumers.  If the production pipeline is quite long so that 
adjustments take a long time, prices may be quite volatile.   
Price volatility in high-storage cost commodities also depends on demand variation.  When 
demand is highly variable, inventory imbalances may often occur.  The production and 
distribution may be unable to adjust as quickly as the demand changes.  For low storage cost 
commodities, inventories generally buffer mismatches in the rates of production and 
consumption so that prices are more stable.   
Finally, price volatility in high-storage cost commodities also depends on whether people can 
easily do without them.  If the demand is highly inelastic, people will demand approximately the 
same quantities at any price.  Such goods often experience sharp price spikes when shortages 
develop. 
Gasoline, Diesel Fuel and Heating Oil Volatility 
Gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil are expensive to store because they require very large tanks.  
The available producer storage in the United States amounts to only 9 days of consumption of 
gasoline and 18 days of distillate fuels (heating oil and diesel fuel).  Since the demands for these 
fuels are highly inelastic, unexpected fluctuations in demand caused by weather, refinery 
accidents, or changes in the economy often cause substantial variation in the prices of these 
commodities.

Administration, US Department of Energy at www.eia.doe.gov. 
 
Perishable goods are goods that become worthless if they are not used before they expire.  The 
prices of perishable goods are often especially volatile because they cannot be stored 
indefinitely.  Where a surplus of soon-to-perish goods exists, prices fall very quickly as their 
owners try to avoid a complete loss.  If a shortage of perishable goods develops, prices may rise 
very quickly.

Part VI 
Evaluation and Prediction 
 
In the next two chapters, we consider how traders measure and predict portfolio performance.  
Traders need to monitor their performance so that they can determine what they are doing well, 
and what they are doing poorly.  They then can better manage their trading.  As a rule, you 
cannot manage what you cannot measure.   
How well a portfolio performs depends on the instruments that are in the portfolio and upon the 
costs of constructing and maintaining the portfolio.  The problem of choosing the best 
instruments to maximize portfolio performance is the portfolio selection/composition problem.  
The problem of implementing portfolio composition decisions is the portfolio implementation 
problem.  Traders must obtain good solutions to both problems to perform well.  
In practice, few profit-motivated traders consistently outperform the market.  Most active traders 
lose because they trade too much and because they pay too much to trade.  The costs of trading 
eventually overwhelm any informational advantages that they may have.  Traders therefore must 
understand their trading costs.  
In Chapter 21, we focus first on measuring and predicting implementation performance.  For 
most traders, the portfolio implementation problem is easier to solve than the 
selection/composition problem.  Because most traders cannot consistently outperform the 
market, the implementation problem is their more important problem.  In Chapter 22, we 
consider why superior selection/composition performance is difficult to achieve and even more 
difficult to predict.

Chapter 21 
Liquidity and Transaction Cost Measurement 
Traders pay attention to their transaction costs because transaction costs make implementation of 
their trading strategies expensive.  Transaction costs are most important to traders who trade 
frequently or who trade large sizes.  For most active traders, transaction costs are the most 
significant determinants of their total returns.  Speculators who perform poorly usually do so 
because their transaction costs exceed the values of their trading strategies. 
Traders measure their transaction costs to evaluate how well they and their brokers have 
implemented their trading strategies.  Traders must evaluate implementation to manage it 
effectively.  They must know whether they have been trading too aggressively—or not 
aggressively enough—to optimize their order submission strategies.  They also must know how 
well their brokers work on their behalf to decide which brokers should receive their orders in the 
future.  
Traders also estimate future transaction costs to predict the costs of implementing various trading 
strategies.  Clever strategies may not be profitable if the costs of implementing them are too 
great.  Transaction cost prediction especially concerns large traders in illiquid markets.  Their 
strategies may be profitable if implemented in small size, but the price impacts of implementing 
them in large size may cause them to lose on net. 
Transaction cost measurement also interests exchanges, brokers, regulators, and investment 
sponsors for the following reasons:   
• Exchanges conduct transaction cost measurement studies to document the quality of their 
markets.  They use the results in their marketing efforts.  They may also use them to evaluate 
their brokers, dealers, and specialists. 
• Brokers conduct transaction cost measurement studies to document their performance.  They 
use the results to identify their shortcomings, to market their firm’s services, and to confirm 
that they obtain best execution for their clients.  The last purpose is especially important 
when dealers pay brokers to route orders to them.  Government regulations, exchange 
regulations, and common law require that brokers ensure that payment for order flow 
arrangements do not hurt their clients.  Brokers therefore must regularly and rigorously 
examine execution quality to ensure the most beneficial terms for their customers' orders.  
• Investment sponsors must ensure that they obtain value for the commissions that their 
investment managers spend on their behalf.  The US Department of Labor requires that 
pension funds covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) recognize 
that trading commissions are fund assets that they must conserve.  Fund trustees therefore 
conduct transaction cost measurement studies to determine whether their funds obtain 
appropriate value for their commissions.  
• Regulators often try to promote policies that lower transaction costs.  Regulators therefore 
conduct transaction cost measurement studies to characterize the performance of various 
market structures.  The US Securities and Exchange Commission now requires that all 
market centers—exchanges, ECNs, and dealers—collect and publish highly disaggregated

data that traders can use to evaluate average execution quality for various order types and 
sizes. 
We consider how to measure liquidity in this chapter.  We will examine both retrospective and 
prospective measures of transaction costs.  We consider first retrospective measures of 
transaction costs.  We then consider how traders use information about past transaction costs to 
predict future transaction costs.  
21.1  Transaction Cost Components 
Defining and measuring exactly what we mean by the term “transaction costs” is difficult.  This 
entire book is about understanding what transaction costs are, where they come from, and how to 
measure them.  We explore these questions in detail throughout this book.   
For our present purposes, transaction costs include all costs associated with trading.  These costs 
include explicit costs, implicit costs, and missed trade opportunity costs.   
Explicit transaction costs are all costs that a cost accountant would easily identify.  These costs 
include commissions paid to brokers, fees paid to exchanges, and taxes paid to government.  
Explicit transaction costs also include any resources that traders devote to the trading process.  
For example, the costs of setting up, staffing, and running a buy side trading desk are all explicit 
costs of trading.   
Implicit transaction costs are the costs of trading that arise because traders generally have an 
impact upon prices.  For example, traders who buy at asking prices and sell at bid prices pay the 
bid/ask spread when trading.  The spread is an obvious and important cost of trading.  Likewise, 
when large buyers push prices up and large sellers push prices down, the price impacts of their 
trading are transaction costs.  
Missed trade opportunity costs arise when traders fail to fill their orders or when they fail to fill 
their orders in a timely manner.  Suppose that a speculator wants to buy 100 cotton futures 
contracts at the New York Board of Trade when the price is 65 cents per pound.  In an effort to 
obtain a good price, the trader submits a buy limit order with a limit price of 64.95 cents.  The 
price of cotton subsequently rises to 68 cents, and the order does not execute.  Had the trader 
traded more aggressively and filled the order at an average price of 65.25 cents, he would have 
made 2.75 cents per pound, or 1,375 dollars for each 50,000-pound contract.  Because the trader 
failed to trade aggressively, he lost the opportunity to make 137,500 dollars.  Traders need to 
keep track of their opportunity costs so that they can determine whether they are trading 
aggressively enough.  
Explicit transaction costs are the most easily measured of the three types of transaction costs.  
Measuring them is a simple cost accounting exercise in which the analyst identifies and sums up 
all commissions, fees, and explicit expenses associated with trade process.   
Implicit transaction costs and missed trade opportunity costs are harder to measure because they 
require some benchmark against which to compare trade and no-trade prices.  To measure the 
price impact of a completed trade, analysts must estimate what prices would have been had the 
trade not taken place.  To measure the opportunity cost of an uncompleted trade, analysts must 
estimate the average prices at which the trade would have taken place had it been completed.  
These estimation problems make transaction cost measurement a difficult and imprecise science.

21.2 Implicit Transaction Cost Estimation Methods 
Traders estimate implicit transaction costs using specified price benchmark methods and 
econometric transaction cost estimation methods.  The price benchmark methods are the most 
commonly used methods.  They are easier to implement than the econometric methods and 
generally more useful when traders need to evaluate transaction costs for specific trades.  The 
econometric methods are most useful for estimating average transaction costs for a whole 
market.   
Most traders measure transaction costs relative to specific price benchmarks.  The price 
benchmark provides a basis for determining whether buyers paid, and sellers received, good or 
bad prices.   
When traders use a specified price benchmark, they estimate the per unit transaction cost as the 
difference between the trade price and the benchmark price.  For a purchase, the estimated cost is 
the excess of the trade price over the benchmark price.  For a sale, it is the opposite.  They then 
multiply this difference by the trade size to obtain the estimated transaction cost: 
   for a purchase
 
   for a sale
TradePrice
BenchmarkPrice
Estimated Cost
TradeSize
BenchmarkPrice
TradePrice

×


 
Estimated transaction costs thus are high when buyers pay high prices, and when sellers receive 
low prices.   
Note that the estimated transaction costs for all buyers and sellers in a trade exactly sum to zero.  
Transaction cost to one side is trading profit to the other side.  Traders who demand liquidity 
tend to pay transaction costs while those who offer liquidity have negative transaction costs.   
The Flip Side 
Transaction costs concern everyone in the trading industry.  Sell side institutions—brokers, 
dealers, and exchanges—try to sell low cost transaction services.  Buy side institutions try to 
obtain transaction services at low cost.  To a casual observer, it would appear that everyone 
wants low transaction costs.  
Not so.  Transaction costs to the buy side are revenues to the sell side.  Sell side institutions 
would like their revenues to be as high as possible.  They only market low cost transaction 
services because they compete with each other for buy side business.  
These comments suggest that sell side institutions benefit from high transaction costs.  While this 
might be true in the short run, it has not been true in the long run.  Decreases in transaction costs 
have caused buy side traders to greatly increase the volume of their trading.  The increased 
volume, coupled with substantial decreases in the costs of providing transaction services, have 
increased sell side profits even as buy side transaction costs have fallen.   
 
For convenience, the difference between the trade price and the benchmark price is often called 
the signed difference, where the sign of the difference is understood to be one if the trade is a 
purchase and minus one if the trade is a sale:

Chapter 22 
Performance Evaluation and Prediction 
Many people trade because they want to speculate successfully.  They hope to profit by buying 
securities and contracts that will rise in value and by selling those that will fall.   
Unfortunately for those of us who would like to get rich quickly, predicting future prices is quite 
difficult.  Some people can do it, but most cannot.  Successful speculators must predict future 
prices well enough to beat the market on average.  Unsuccessful speculators eventually lose 
money when trading.  At best, they make less money than they would have made had they 
simply bought and held index funds.  If they trade only because they want to earn speculative 
trading profits, they should stop trading.  
In this chapter, we consider how to measure past performance and how to predict future 
performance.  The two questions are closely related.  Most people measure past performance 
primarily because they want to predict future performance.  We shall see why predictions based 
only on past performance generally are quite unreliable.  We can predict performance better 
using other information. 
You must be able to predict performance if you intend to speculate.  Speculators trade only 
because they expect to profit.  Successful speculators therefore must constantly consider whether 
their trades will be profitable.  If you cannot predict whether you will trade profitably, you 
should not speculate.  The most important decision speculators make is whether they should 
trade.   
You also must be able to predict performance if you employ active investment managers to 
speculate on your behalf.  Active investment managers speculate with their clients’ money.  They 
are active, as opposed to passive, because they actively try to identify and exploit speculative 
opportunities.  Accordingly, they often trade frequently.  You can hire their services by 
employing them as investment advisors or you can obtain their services indirectly by buying the 
mutual funds and commodity pools that they manage.  In either event, when managers speculate 
on your behalf, you speculate on their success.  To select good active investment managers, you 
must predict which ones will speculate successfully.  If you cannot predict which managers will 
be successful, you should not employ active investment managers.  The most important decision 
investment sponsors make is whether to employ active managers. 
Investors who believe that they cannot speculate successfully often invest their money with 
passive investment managers.  Passive investment managers use buy and hold strategies.  They 
simply buy and hold securities.  Passive managers therefore rarely trade.  The most common buy 
and hold strategy is the index replication strategy.  Index replicators buy and hold portfolios that 
they design to replicate the returns to a broad market index.  We discuss how they do this in the 
next chapter (Index Markets).   
Indexing is very popular because many investors have decided that they do not want to speculate.  
They do not believe that they would be successful traders, and they do not believe that they can 
pick successful managers.  The limitations of performance evaluation and prediction help explain 
why index markets are so popular.

People often design investment management contracts so that the payments that investment 
managers receive depend on the performance they produce.  Such contracts encourage 
investment managers to better serve their clients.  You must appreciate the limitations of 
performance evaluation to understand how to best compensate investment managers and to 
understand the problems that arise in typical investment management contracts.  
Our discussion begins with a discussion of the principal problem of discriminating between skill 
and luck.  We then briefly consider the mechanics of performance evaluation.  If you already 
know how analysts compute returns, and how and why they compare them to benchmark returns, 
you can skip this section.  The discussion then turns to the problem of predicting performance.  
We consider first how statisticians approach the problem and explain why their approach is not 
very powerful.  We then will consider alternative approaches to performance prediction based on 
economic theory.  
By the end of this chapter, you will understand why past performance does not necessarily 
predict future returns.  You will also understand how sample selection biases affect the 
inferences you may make about investment decisions.  Failures to understand these issues 
probably account for more trading losses than any other mistakes traders make.  
22.1 The Performance Evaluation Problem 
Portfolio performance depends partly on the quality of its management.  Managers that perform 
well add value to their portfolios.  Managers that perform poorly waste value.   
Portfolio performance also depends on every factor that determines the values of the instruments 
in the portfolio.  The factors may include macroeconomic, microeconomic, and firm-specific 
factors.  Macroeconomic factors include changes in interest rates, general economic activity, 
productivity, and exchange rates.  Microeconomic factors include industry supply and demand 
conditions, technological innovations, and government interventions.  Firm-specific factors 
include a host of issues ranging from whether the firm is well managed to whether factories burn 
accidentally down to whether researchers make fortuitous discoveries. 
Active managers try to foresee every factor that will affect values.  They then buy those 
instruments that they expect will appreciate and sell those that they expect will depreciate.  If 
they are very skilled, they will be able to add substantial value to their portfolios by selecting 
which instruments to buy and which to sell.   
No one can anticipate most factors that affect portfolio returns.  Unforeseeable factors therefore 
have a seemingly random effect on performance.  Portfolios that perform well may be managed 
by skilled managers or by lucky managers.  Likewise, poor performing portfolios may be 
managed by unskilled managers or by unlucky managers.   
Sizzler Sick with E. Coli 
Sizzler International is an operator/franchiser of family restaurants that specialize in grilled 
meats.  Sizzler operates 65 company stores in the United States, and it franchises another 200 
stores.  In 1998, the company reorganized in a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  By the middle 
of 2000, its earnings were accelerating and many analysts, who had carefully studied the 
company and its future prospects, believed that it had a winning strategy for revitalizing the

22-3 
chain.  Based on their research, many investment managers bought Sizzler expecting that it 
would outperform the market.   
They did not realize their expectations.  In July 2000, the bacterium E. Coli infected 42 patrons 
of a Milwaukee Sizzler franchise.  Seventeen were hospitalized and a three year-old girl died 
from complications resulting from the infection.   
Eating undercooked meats, or food contaminated by raw meat, spreads the E. Coli infection.  
The Milwaukee Health Commissioner believed that eating contaminated watermelon spread the 
infection. 
News about the outbreak was well publicized throughout the country.  Following the 
announcement, Sizzler’s stock fell 35 percent as investors feared the lawsuits and the lost 
reputation that would surely follow this tragic event. 
The speculators who bought Sizzler may have been very well informed about its future 
prospects.  They undoubtedly knew that food poisoning episodes occasionally plague restaurant 
chains, and they probably discounted Sizzler’s stock—and those of other restaurant chains—
accordingly.  Some even may have considered whether Sizzler designed and implemented 
adequate sanitary procedures to appropriately control the risks that they faced.  Despite all these 
considerations, the Sizzler E. Coli food poisoning episode probably was not predictable.  These 
investors were simply unlucky. 
 
The investment policies that govern many portfolios often have a substantial effect on portfolio 
performance.  These policies may prohibit skilled managers from exploiting positive factors or 
from avoiding negative factors.  They also may force unskilled managers to unknowingly exploit 
positive factors or avoid negative factors.  Portfolios that perform well therefore may be 
managed by skilled managers or simply by lucky managers subject to investment policies that 
the market currently favors.  Likewise, poor performing portfolios may be managed by unskilled 
managers or by skilled managers subject to investment policies that currently are out of favor.  
For example, consider the performance of portfolios that must be fully invested in equity.  These 
portfolios fluctuate in value with the market regardless of how management operates.  When the 
market rises, even the worst managed portfolios may have high positive returns.  A market rise 
can offset losses due to inept management.  Likewise, when the market falls, the best-managed 
portfolios may have negative returns.  A market fall can overwhelm gains due to superior 
management.   
Unforeseeable factors and unavoidable factors greatly complicate the performance evaluation 
problem.  These factors make it difficult to estimate the manager’s contribution to portfolio 
performance.  Good performance evaluations must discriminate between skill and luck.  Analysts 
must break total performance into separate components representing the contribution due to 
management and the contribution due to factors that no one could anticipate or control. 
The task of estimating the contribution of factors that no one could anticipate or control is very 
difficult because so many factors affect portfolio returns.  Even the best estimates of manager 
performance are quite noisy.  Discriminating between skill and luck as explanations for portfolio 
performance is very difficult.

Market Structures 
 
The final chapters of this book examine the economics of market structures.  The topics we 
consider encompass many active regulatory debates.   
In Chapter 23, we consider why index markets are organized as they are.  Our discussion shows 
how uninformed traders benefit from trading indexes. 
Chapter 24 examines the specialist trading system.  Specialists are broker-dealers who supply 
liquidity and arrange trades at exchanges and at some proprietary trading firms.  Exchanges, 
regulators, and their business models sometimes compel specialists to supply liquidity when they 
otherwise would not want to do so.  To encourage them to offer such liquidity, they must receive 
some benefit from their unique positions.  
The next three chapters examine how markets and dealers compete against each other for order 
flow.  We examine internalization and order preferencing by dealers in Chapter 25, why markets 
consolidate and fragment in Chapter 26, and screen versus floor based trading in Chapter 27.  We 
pay special attention to the problems that result when traders can trade the same instruments in 
different places. 
Chapter 28 discusses the origins of extreme volatility.  There we consider how market structures 
contribute to—and mitigate—volatility.  We also consider whether markets should have circuit 
breakers to control excess volatility. 
Chapter 29 considers the benefits and consequences of prohibiting insider trading.  Interestingly, 
the most important issues involve labor economics rather than market microstructure.

Chapter 23 
Index and Portfolio Markets 
Index trading is one of the most important financial innovations of the twentieth century.  The 
nominal dollar value of trading in equity index products now is greater than the total dollar value 
of trading in the underlying securities.  The growth of index trading has had a profound effect on 
equity markets.  It is also increasingly affecting debt markets.  
Index markets trade index products.  Index products include index futures contracts, index 
options contracts, and securities that represent ownership in index funds.  Index funds are 
portfolios that their managers design to replicate the performance of various price indexes.  Most 
index funds track market equity indexes.  Some funds also track debt indexes and sector equity 
indexes. 
Index products and index markets are extremely popular.  Many people have decided that they 
would rather invest in an index product than risk losing money investing with an active 
investment manager.  Index products also are attractive to speculators who want to speculate 
only on index risks or only on firm-specific risks.  The former buy or sell index products to 
establish their speculative positions.  The latter sell or buy index products to hedge the index risk 
in their long or short positions in individual securities.  
The widespread use of index strategies has changed the character of markets.  Index markets are 
far more liquid than the underlying cash markets upon which their products are based.  Price 
changes in index products generally lead changes in the cash index.  Consequently, many people 
believe that index markets are the “tail that wags the dog.”  You must understand index strategies 
to understand the relation between index markets and their underlying cash markets.  
In this chapter, we will briefly consider how indexes are computed, and how index funds are 
managed.  We then will consider why index products and index markets are so popular.  You 
may find this section particularly useful if you are unsure of whether you should invest or 
speculate in equities.  The chapter closes with a discussion of the various ways that traders 
exchange index risks. 
23.1 Price Indexes  
People use price indexes to characterize the values of lists of instruments.  The instruments upon 
which a price index is based are the index components.  The index components determine the 
character of the index.  Indexes exist for entire markets, for subsets of a market, and for sets of 
markets.  The instruments may be equities, debt securities, commodities, or currencies.  Indexes 
that only include a small subset of market securities are narrow indexes.  Narrow indexes have 
been defined for small and large securities, value and growth securities, industry sector 
securities, and securities of firms that do business in narrow geographic regions. 
Most price indexes are proprietary products that exchanges, brokers, or data vendors compute.  
Although index creators sometimes sell their indexes, they also often offer them to their clients 
to promote their businesses.  Many index creators also license their indexes to firms that base 
index products upon them.

All price indexes are essentially just averages of the prices of their index components.  Indexes 
differ by the methods used to compute those averages.  The two most common index types are 
price-weighted and value-weighted indexes. 
A price-weighted index is proportional to the sum of the prices of the index components.  The 
highest priced instruments therefore have the greatest influence over the values of price-weighted 
indexes.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average are the 
best-known price-weighted indexes.   
The Major Market Index and The Major Market Index 
Dow Jones and Co. owns the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which is a price-weighted 
index of 30 large US stocks.  The list originally included only industrial stocks.  It now includes 
some stocks in the finance and services sectors of the economy.  The Dow 30 is the best-known 
US market index.  It is the major market index. 
For many years, Dow Jones refused to license the DJIA to options and futures exchanges that 
wanted to create contracts based upon it.  The American Stock Exchange therefore created an 
index called the Major Market Index (MMI).  The MMI is a price-weighted index of 20 blue chip 
stocks.  Not coincidentally, most of the stock MMI stocks are also Dow 30 stocks.  Changes in 
the MMI therefore are very closely correlated with changes in the DJIA.  The American Stock 
Exchange trades options on the MMI using the ticker symbol XMI.  They also licensed the index 
to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which traded futures on it.   
In 1997, Dow Jones finally licensed the DJIA to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and to the 
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).  The CBOT Dow Jones Industrials futures and the 
CBOE Dow Jones Industrials options contracts have been very successful.  Both have killed their 
respective MMI competitors.  The CME stopped trading their MMI contract in 1999.  Although 
the AMEX MMI options contract continues to trade (as of December 2001), it no longer has 
significant open interest.  
 
A value-weighted index is proportional to the total capital value of all index components.  
Traders therefore also call value-weighted indexes capitalization-weighted indexes.  Securities 
with the highest capital value have the greatest influence over the values of value-weighted 
indexes.  Most price indexes are value-weighted indexes.  The S&P 500 Index is the best-known 
value-weighted index.   
The value of an index is obtained by dividing the price or value sum by a constant index divisor.  
The divisor originally was a number that the index creator chose to ensure that the index started 
at an arbitrary initial value.  Divisors now change only when necessary to ensure that the value of 
an index does not change when the creator adds or deletes index components, or, in the case of a 
price-weighted index, when a stock splits.  For example, the divisor of a price-weighted index 
must increase when a high priced stock replaces a low priced stock.  Otherwise, the change 
would unnaturally increase the value of the index.  Likewise, the divisor of a value-weighted 
index must increase when a high capitalization stock replaces a low capitalization stock.  The 
divisors of value-weighted indexes do not have to change when stocks split because splits do not 
change total capital values. 
You may occasionally encounter equal-weighted and geometrically weighted indexes.  Equal-
weighted indexes measure the returns from investing an equal dollar amount in each index

23-3 
component.  The index values represent the cumulative returns to this hypothetical investment 
strategy.  The best-known equal-weighted index is the CRSP (Center for Research in Security 
Prices) equal-weighted market index.  It is used primarily in academic research.  Geometrically 
weighted indexes average logarithmic returns rather than prices.  The Value-Line Geometric 
Index is a value-weighted index of logarithmic returns. 
A price index is dividend-adjusted if it is adjusted upwards when securities pay dividends.  
Traders also call dividend-adjusted indexes total return indexes because they measure the total 
return—capital gains plus income yield—that investors would receive if they could invest in the 
index without any transaction costs.  People generally use total return indexes as benchmarks 
against which they measure the performance of their portfolios.  The DJIA and the S&P 500 
Index are not dividend-adjusted indexes.  Corresponding total return indexes for these two 
indexes, however, are widely available.   
23.2 Index Funds 
An index fund is a portfolio that index managers design to replicate the performance of an index.  
Tracking error is the difference between the portfolio return and the corresponding dividend-
adjusted index return.  Index fund managers try to minimize their tracking errors.  Most US 
index funds try to replicate the S&P 500 Index, although other indexes are becoming 
increasingly popular. 
They Each Manage about 3 Percent of All World Equity 
Barclays Global Investors is the world’s largest index fund manager.  As of December 2000, the 
firm had 571 billion dollars under management in various US and international equity index 
funds.  (The firm had 802 billion dollars of assets under management counting all asset classes.)  
By comparison, total world traded equity market capitalization was then approximately 31 
trillion dollars.  Counting only index funds, Barclays Global Investors manages a bit less than 2 
percent of all traded equity in the world.  
The world’s largest equity manager is Deutsche Asset Management which manages about 1 
trillion dollars worldwide in many subsidiaries.

Replicating a value-weighted equity index is quite simple.  If the value of the index fund is 0.01 
percent of the total capitalization of all the index components, the index fund manager simply 
buys 0.01 percent of the outstanding shares of each index component.  The value of the fund 
therefore is exactly proportional to the total value of all index components, which is proportional 
to the value of the value-weighted index.  Consequently, percentage changes in these three 
quantities will be identical.  Index managers must rebalance a value-weighted portfolio only 
when the list of index components changes.  Otherwise, the fund simply holds its securities. 
Replicating a price-weighted equity index is equally simple.  The index fund simply holds an 
equal number of shares in each index component.  The value of the portfolio therefore is 
proportional to the sum of the prices of the index components, which is proportional to the price-
weighted index.  Percentage changes in these three quantities therefore will be identical.  Index

Chapter 24 
Specialists 
Some exchanges assign special responsibilities to members they designate as specialists.  The 
specialists must continuously quote two-sided markets so that markets always exist in their 
specialties.  They must also ensure that their markets are orderly and that prices do not jump too 
quickly. 
Exchanges that designate specialists have designated primary market maker trading systems, or 
more simply, specialist trading systems.  The largest equity exchange that designates specialists 
is the New York Stock Exchange.  
Exchanges with specialist trading systems believe that their specialists enhance market quality 
and thereby attract traders to their exchanges.  They believe that continuous and orderly markets 
increase investor confidence so that investors are more willing to invest in the exchanges’ listed 
companies.  By attracting investor interest, these exchanges encourage issuers to list their 
securities with them.  The exchanges thereby obtain greater revenues from listing fees and 
transaction fees, and their members make greater profits as brokers and dealers.   
In this chapter, we describe the various obligations that exchanges impose upon their specialists.  
We show how these obligations often require that specialists trade when they do not want to 
trade and refrain from trading when they do want to trade.  Specialist obligations therefore can 
be quite costly to specialists.  To encourage traders to accept these obligations, exchanges give 
specialists various trading privileges.  We describe these privileges and explain how specialists 
profit from them.  To prevent abuses of these privileges, exchanges also impose restrictions on 
when specialists may trade.   
Although all traders appreciate the liquidity that exchanges obligate their specialists to provide, 
many traders resent that they have special privileges.  The special privileges can be quite 
valuable to specialists and hence costly to other traders.  The specialist trading system therefore 
is the subject of regulatory controversy.  Regulators must consider whether the value that 
specialists obtain from their privileges is commensurate with the value of the services that they 
provide.  The traders who benefit when specialists fulfill their obligations usually are not the 
same traders who are hurt when specialists exercise their privileges.  Regulators therefore also 
must consider whether the resulting transfers of wealth among traders are appropriate. 
You must understand the specialist trading system if you trade at exchanges that employ such 
systems.  At such exchanges, the execution of your orders will somehow involve specialists.  
They may act as your broker, they may act as dealers and fill your orders for their accounts, or 
they may conduct the auctions in which brokers match your orders to other traders’ orders.  You 
will make better trading decisions when you understand how specialists handle your orders.  
You also must understand the specialist trading system to understand how markets compete with 
each other.  The liquidity services that specialists offer are public goods in the sense that 
everyone benefits from them.  Unfortunately, public goods are hard to obtain in competitive 
markets.  Few people will pay for them when they can freely obtain them.  Regulators who value 
the liquidity that specialists offer must therefore carefully consider how markets compete with 
each other.  We introduce these issues at the end of this chapter and expand upon them when we 
consider how markets compete with each other in Chapter 26.

Finally, you must understand the specialist trading system to responsibly consider whether floor-
based exchanges that use specialist trading systems should convert to screen-based trading 
systems.  Although exchanges can build a screen-based specialist trading system, many issues 
make such a structure unlikely.  Analyses of conversions to screen-based trading therefore 
should consider the benefits lost and the costs saved if the specialist trading system were 
scrapped.  This chapter will help you identify these benefits and costs.  
Specialist trading systems differ across exchanges.  The distinguishing characteristic of these 
systems is that they impose obligations on dealers to supply liquidity.  The obligations vary, 
however.  Most exchanges restrict the trades that specialists can do, but some do not.  This 
chapter provides a general discussion of the principal economic and regulatory issues that arise 
in connection with all designated primary market maker trading systems.  These issues are 
common to all variants of these systems.  The examples that we will consider to illustrate these 
principals, however, are specific to the specialist trading systems that the New York and the 
American Stock Exchanges use.  
24.1 Overview 
Specialist trading systems are found primarily at US stock and options exchanges.  Some 
markets in other countries also use them.  The specialist trading system is most important at the 
New York and American Stock Exchanges.  The US regional stock exchanges also have 
specialist trading systems, but most regional specialists are more like third market dealers than 
primary stock exchange specialists.  The equity options markets organized by the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange, the Pacific Exchange, and the 
Philadelphia Stock Exchange also use specialist trading systems. 
Specialists are known by different names in various markets.  The CBOE calls its specialists 
designated primary market makers.  The Deutsche Börse calls its specialists designated sponsors 
in English and betreuers in German.  At the Paris Bourse, they are known as animateurs.   
Third market dealers also often call their traders specialists.  The business models of these firms 
often obligate their traders to offer liquidity when they otherwise might not want to do so.  These 
obligations are voluntary, however.  The dealers propose and accept them as conditions for 
obtaining order flow from brokers.  The NASD, the SEC, and some court decisions restrict the 
trades that these dual traders can do.  These restrictions, however, usually are not as severe as 
those that exchanges impose upon their specialists.  
Most specialists are dual traders who sometimes broker orders for their clients and other times 
fill orders for their clients from their own inventories.  Exchanges that permit dual trading 
generally employ many regulatory safeguards to solve the resulting conflict of interest problems 
introduced in Chapter 7 (Brokers).  Specialists therefore are subject to many regulations.  
Exchanges with specialist trading systems usually assign only one specialist to each stock or 
options class.  We will discuss below how they make these assignments.  
Some exchanges use a designated multiple market maker trading system for trading their 
securities.  These systems are similar to specialist systems except that the exchanges obligate 
multiple traders to offer liquidity that they otherwise might not want to offer.  These obligations 
are best enforced in electronic markets because traders in open outcry markets will hide when

24-3 
they do not want to trade.  When nobody wants to trade, a computer usually assigns the 
obligation to trade in rotation to each of the designated market makers.   
The CBOE uses a designated multiple market maker trading system for its most actively traded 
index options series.  Unlike most specialists, their designated market makers are not dual 
traders.  They deal only for their account, and they do not broker agency orders.  Like specialists, 
the market makers have some obligations to provide liquidity when markets are not trading 
normally.  Similar structures appear at some European options exchanges and at some futures 
exchanges.  
The number of stocks or option classes that each specialist trades depends on how actively traded 
the instruments are.  Specialists who specialize in very actively traded securities usually trade 
only one security or options class.  Those who specialize in less frequently traded securities trade 
larger lists.  Most specialists trade only a few securities.  For example, most of the 482 individual 
specialists at the New York Stock Exchange trade between three and six stocks each.  They 
usually have one actively traded security and a few less actively traded ones.   
Most specialists work for firms that employ many specialists.  In December 2001, only eight 
firms employed all specialists at the NYSE.  Five of these firms handled stocks representing 95 
percent of all the NYSE dollar volume. 
Specialists play three roles in most markets.  They are dealers when they trade for their own 
account.  They are brokers when they broker orders and trades for other brokers.  Finally, they 
are exchange officials who are responsible for conducting orderly markets.  We consider these 
three main roles in the next three sections. 
24.2 Specialists as Dealers 
Specialists act as dealers when they trade for their own accounts.  Exchanges greatly regulate the 
trading that specialists can and must do for their own accounts.   
Two sets of regulations govern specialist trading.  Affirmative obligations obligate specialists to 
offer liquidity in various circumstances.  Negative obligations prevent them from trading in other 
circumstances.  Specialists accept these obligations because they enjoy the various privileges that 
come with them.  
24.2.1 Affirmative Obligations 
The specialists’ primary affirmative obligation is to ensure that a reasonable market always 
exists in their specialties.  When no one else is willing to trade, specialists must be willing to 
trade.  They must quote two-sided markets when no one else will, and their quotes must be 
meaningful in the sense that the spread between the best bid and the best offer cannot be too 
wide.  Since specialists must often trade when no one else is willing to trade, they are often the 
traders of last resort.  
Their obligation to make markets is limited, however.  Specialists do not have to make firm 
quotes for large block sizes, and they are not required to support prices when values are falling or 
restrain prices when values are rising.  They simply have to ensure that public traders can always 
trade some meaningful quantity.

Chapter 25 
Internalization, Preferencing, and Crossing 
Dealers internalize orders when they fill their clients’ orders.  Brokers preference orders when 
they route their clients’ marketable orders to dealers in exchange for various monetary or 
nonpecuniary payments for order flow.  Brokers also preference when they route their clients’ 
limit orders to electronic communications networks (ECNs) that pay them liquidity fees when 
standing limit orders execute.  Brokers cross orders internally when they arrange trades among 
their clients.   
Internalization, order preferencing, and internal order crossing all arrange trades away from 
organized markets.  Traders say that these practices fragment the markets.  
Internalization, preferencing, and crossing practices raise important regulatory questions.  Most 
notably, clients and regulators wonder whether brokers who engage in these practices meet their 
obligations to obtain best execution when filling their clients’ orders.  Less obviously, traders 
and regulators wonder whether these practices hurt markets by making it more difficult for 
traders to find each other.  All three practices decrease order transparency.  Many people wonder 
whether the markets would be better off with a single consolidated limit order book to which 
brokers would send all orders.  
In this short chapter, we discuss the issues that underlie these processes.  We shall see that 
internalization and preferencing may benefit small market order traders.  The practices generally 
harm limit order traders, however.  Internal order crossing tends to benefit crossing brokers and 
their clients at the expense of traders with whom the clients might have otherwise traded.  
Internalization, preferencing, and crossing affect all markets in which traders can trade away 
from a central exchange.  These practices have attracted the substantial attention in US equity 
markets.  The attention undoubtedly comes from the high volumes traded in these markets, the 
high degree of transparency in these markets, and the ease with which traders and regulators can 
compare dealer and public auction markets that simultaneously trade similar securities.  Most of 
the discussion that appears in this chapter therefore draws on examples from US markets.  The 
forces that cause internalization, order preferencing, and internal order crossing, however, are 
present in all markets.  If you understand how these forces work in US equity markets, you will 
be able to identify them in all other markets. 
We start by discussing best execution and the effects of internalization and preferencing on 
commissions.  We then discuss the anticompetitive aspects of internalization and preferencing.  
The chapter ends with a short discussion about issues associated with internal order crossing.  
25.1 Best Execution Practices 
Brokers who internalize and accept payments for order flow have a significant conflict of interest 
that concerns clients and regulators.  Brokers address these concerns by trying to provide best 
execution to their clients.  Brokers provide best execution when they ensure that their clients’ 
orders quickly fill at the best available prices.

Definitions of best execution are controversial because determining whether dealers fill orders at 
the best available prices is difficult.  It is especially difficult when willing traders do not display 
their orders and quotes.   
Definitions of best execution are also controversial because price is only one dimension of 
execution quality.  Traders value speed of execution as well as price.  The relative importance of 
speed and price depends on order type.  Market order traders are primarily concerned about 
speed whereas limit order traders are most concerned about price.  All traders, however, value 
both dimensions and accept reasonable tradeoffs between speed and price.   
Brokers and the dealers to whom they preference orders have created a standard set of order 
handling practices that they claim assures best execution if followed.  You may disagree.  The 
procedures vary by order type.  
In US equity markets, dealers claim that they provide best execution when they fill marketable 
orders at the national best bid or offer (NBBO)—the best bid or offer quoted by any other dealer 
or limit order trader.  This standard applies only to marketable orders that are smaller than the 
total displayed quotation size at the best price.  Best execution for larger marketable orders is 
harder to define because undisclosed size might also be available at the best price.  To attract 
order flow, some dealers guarantee to brokers that they will always fill orders at the BBO up to a 
specified maximum size, regardless of the size displayed in the market. 
In some markets, small market orders often trade at better prices than the best quoted price.  In 
such markets, brokers must obtain average rates of price improvement for small market orders to 
ensure best execution.  Dealers who fill their orders generally use complex algorithms to provide 
price improvement given various market conditions.  These algorithms often expose an order to 
the market at an improved price.  If anyone trades anywhere at that price, dealers then fill the 
order at that price. 
The Primex Auction System 
The Primex Auction System allows participants to expose their marketable orders to an 
electronic crowd of traders who may offer improved prices.  The Nasdaq Stock Market operates 
the system as a facility under an agreement between Nasdaq and Primex Trading. 
Several large financial services firms, which have very large dealing operations, own Primex 
Trading.  They include Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, Goldman Sachs, Merrill 
Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Co., and Salomon Smith Barney.

Best execution standards for standing limit orders are also difficult to define.  Since standing 
limit orders typically execute at their limit prices, brokerage clients are most concerned about 
whether and when their orders execute.  Best execution for orders that are not marketable upon 
submission therefore depends on whether and when they execute.   
In markets that match public orders to public orders, best execution standards for standing limit 
orders are especially difficult to define.  Clients generally expect that their brokers will represent 
their orders wherever they have the highest probability of executing.  Brokers who internalize 
their agency orders or who preference them to dealers must ensure that they execute at least as

25-3 
soon as they would otherwise execute in the primary markets.  Many dealers who accept limit 
orders have limit order price protection procedures to provide this standard of best execution.   
Best Execution of Limit Orders by Third Market Dealers in NYSE-listed Stocks 
Many third market dealers who accept agency limit orders for NYSE-listed stocks use some 
version of the following algorithm to provide best execution for limit buy orders.  They use 
similar procedures for limit sell orders.   
If the limit order bids a better price than the dealer is bidding, the dealer will adjust his bid to 
reflect the limit order price and size.  If the two prices are the same, but the limit order bids for 
more size than does the dealer, the dealer will increase his bid size to the order size.   
While the limit price matches the best bid in the market, the dealer will match any marketable 
sell orders that he receives with the limit buy order.  If a trade occurs anywhere at a price below 
the limit order price, the dealer will fill the limit order for his own account at the limit price.  The 
dealer may fill all of the order, or just the size of the trade that occurred below the limit order 
price.   
When the limit order price is first equal to the best bid in the market, and the NYSE quote is also 
at the best bid, the dealer will record the size of the NYSE bid.  If the NYSE bid is behind the 
best bid, the dealer will record zero NYSE size.  He then will count volume traded everywhere at 
the limit price.  When that total volume exceeds the recorded NYSE size, the dealer will execute 
the limit buy order for his own account.  
The dealer also may place a limit order into the NYSE specialist’s limit order book at the same 
price.  If the NYSE order fills, he will fill his agency limit order.  If he fills the agency order 
first, he will immediately cancel the NYSE order.  By placing the NYSE order, he ensures that 
he will obtain no worse execution for the agency order than it would have received had it gone to 
the NYSE.  He can also query the SuperDot order routing system for the size ahead of the order. 
 
The fact that dealers pay for marketable orders suggests—but does not necessarily imply—that 
they could provide better execution services than they do.  In particular, dealers may not be 
providing as much price improvement for marketable orders as they might.  They may also be 
extracting too much option value from standing limit orders that brokers often force them to 
accept as a condition of receiving marketable orders.  If brokers demanded more price 
improvement and better limit order executions, dealers would pay less for their preferenced order 
flows. 
To fully understand how payments for order flow affect retail traders, we must consider more 
than just that the payments exist.  We also must consider how those payments are determined, 
and what effect those payments have on retail brokerage commissions.  The next subsection 
describes the economic factors that determine payments for order flow, and how they affect 
brokerage commissions.   
25.2 The Economics of Best Execution 
We start our discussion with a well-known property of all competitive markets.  In perfectly 
competitive markets, nobody earns profits in excess of a fair rate of return on their dedicated 
resources.  Perfectly competitive markets arise when suppliers with identical cost functions can

Competition within and among Markets 
In the last few years, many exchanges, brokers, electronic communications networks (ECNs), 
and dealers have created innovative trading systems to provide traders with better services at 
lower costs.  The competition among these market centers is significantly changing how all 
markets operate, and the pace of change is accelerating.  
The competition among market centers has some worrisome consequences, however.  The 
proliferation of market centers is fragmenting the markets.  Buyers and sellers often are in 
different places so that they may have trouble finding each other.  Their transaction costs 
therefore may be higher than they would be if all traders traded in the same place.  The benefits 
of competition among market centers may be offset by the increased costs it creates for traders 
who are searching for the best price.   
Where Is the Market for AOL? 
AOL Time Warner common stock trades in each of the following market centers: 
• The New York Stock Exchange, its primary listing market.   
• All US regional exchanges:  The Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Pacific, and Philadelphia 
Exchanges.   
• Most ECNs and alternative trading systems (ATSs).  The most important of these are Island, 
Instinet, REDIBook, Archipelago, Bloomberg Tradebook, BRUT, and POSIT.   
• The third market and Nasdaq.  Bernard Madoff Investment Securities and Knight Capital 
Markets are the largest dealers in these markets. 
• The upstairs block trading market.   
• Some large foreign stock exchanges. 
The risk in AOL common stock also trades in the following derivative contract markets: 
• US options exchanges all trade AOL stock options contracts cleared by the Options Clearing 
Corporation.  These include the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock 
Exchange, the Pacific Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and the International 
Securities Exchange. 
• Futures contracts on AOL common stock shares trade at several exchanges. 
• Many large investment banks will write individually tailored synthetic derivatives contracts 
in AOL for their clients.  
 
A market in which people can trade essentially the same thing in different market centers is a 
fragmented market.  A market in which all traders trade in the same market center is a 
consolidated market.   
Regulators and practitioners wonder whether markets should be consolidated or fragmented.  
Regulations can produce either alternative.  Most futures markets are fully consolidated, as are 
some national stock markets.

The issue is quite complicated.  The competition among traders to obtain the best price works 
best in consolidated markets.  The competition among market centers to provide low cost 
services to traders, however, implies fragmented markets.  The two competitions therefore are 
inconsistent with each other.  Any reasonable attempts to address competitive issues must 
consider why market fragmentation occurs, and what are the benefits and costs of market 
diversity.  
Slogans Don’t Help 
All languages promote wisdom with slogans.  Slogans, however, will not resolve debates on 
market structure.  For example, “United We Stand, Divided We Fall” suggests that consolidated 
markets are good, but “Strength through Diversity” suggests that fragmented markets are good.  
When applied to market structure, these two slogans promote the two different competitions that 
take place in the trading industry.  The first slogan promotes the competition of traders to find 
the best price while the second promotes the competition among market centers to provide the 
best services.   
 
In this chapter, we consider the economic forces that cause markets to consolidate and to 
fragment.  Our discussion starts with a short description of how technology has changed trading 
markets.  This part presents the technological context of the main issues.  The economic analysis 
starts with a discussion of why markets consolidate.  We then consider why markets fragment, 
and how fragmented markets coalesce into segmented markets.  Finally, we address the public 
policy problems related to externalities among market segments.   
26.1 Trading Systems and Technology 
New trading systems have proliferated largely due to advances in communications and 
computing technologies.  New communications technologies have given traders instantaneous 
presence in markets that they formerly could not attend.  Traders no longer need to be on an 
exchange floor to know what is happening there or to trade effectively.  Instantaneous market 
data reporting systems and order routing systems now allow traders anywhere in the world to see 
and act upon opportunities wherever they occur.   
From Dispatch Messenger to ECN 
In the beginning, markets reported some trade prices—and almost no quotations—by dispatch 
messengers.  They usually traveled by horseback and ship.  Later they reported prices by carrier 
pigeon, semaphore, telegraph, telex, and telephone.  Now most organized markets continuously 
report all trade prices and all quotations as they occur via dedicated communications systems run 
by computers.  Information that once moved at equine speed now moves at the speed of light.  
Likewise, traders once made all trading decisions themselves and brokers once arranged all 
trades manually.  Now computers commonly make and implement trading decisions while 
dedicated exchange, ECN, broker, and dealer trading systems arrange trades automatically.   
 
New computing technologies have allowed market centers to organize sophisticated algorithm-
based order-matching systems that would be impossible to implement by hand.  These systems


<!-- PAGE 101 -->

26-3 
provide traders with complex order management tools that permit traders to more effectively 
solve their trading problems.  Examples of such features include systems that  
• display orders only to traders who commit to filling them,  
• ensure that a trader buys and sells equal dollar values,  
• ensure an order that is part of a larger strategy will fill only if all orders in the strategy fill,  
• allow traders to submit orders with limit prices indexed to market conditions, and 
• substitute orders in one instrument for orders in another instrument based on market 
conditions. 
Trading systems that incorporate these features use complex rules to treat all traders fairly 
subject to various constraints.  They could not be implemented without the assistance of a 
computer.  New computing technologies therefore have allowed markets to develop new 
applications that formerly would have been economically infeasible. 
The OM SAXESS Trading System  
OM Gruppen of Stockholm sells and operates exchange trading systems.  Their SAXESS system 
allows traders to submit various types of contingency orders: combination orders, linked orders, 
stop loss orders, block orders, and balance orders.  The algorithms necessary to provide these 
services are quite complex because the execution of some orders is contingent on the execution 
of other orders.   
Source:  http://www.omgroup.com/  
 
Even when clerks can effectively operate a trading system by hand, they are not as cost effective 
as are computers.  New computing technologies therefore have allowed market centers to lower 
the costs of existing services in addition to providing new services.   
26.1.1 A Very Short History of Fragmentation and Consolidation 
In the beginning, most trading occurred on the trading floors of regional exchanges.  Professional 
traders wanted to belong to these exchanges because only by being on these floors could they 
learn about market conditions and access trading opportunities.  Nonmembers traded through 
member-brokers because that was the only way they could trade in these markets.  Although no 
single market structure can simultaneously best serve the needs of all traders, most traders traded 
at exchanges because everyone traded there. 
Trading in many instruments fragmented across regional exchanges because impatient traders 
would not send their orders to distant exchanges.  These traders incurred high transaction costs to 
compensate dealers who moved liquidity through time and arbitragers who moved liquidity from 
market to market.  Wide arbitrage spreads reflected the high costs of obtaining information and 
acting upon it across large distances.   
When new communications technologies reduced the costs of transmitting market information 
and orders, regional exchanges consolidated to form large international markets.  Where 
permitted, many alternative trading systems operate on the periphery of these markets.  These 
systems provide special services to traders whose needs vary substantially.  Arbitrageurs ensure 
that prices in all systems reflect market conditions throughout the world.

Floor versus Automated Trading Systems 
Advances in communications and computing technologies now allow exchanges to completely 
automate their trading systems.  Many exchanges have done so and many brokers, ECNs, and 
dealers have created automated trading systems.   
Despite these developments, many of the most liquid exchanges in the world still employ floor-
based trading systems.  The New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and almost all US options 
exchanges primarily use floor-based trading systems.  Although traders on their floors now rely 
extensively on electronic systems to route orders and report confirmations, they still arrange 
trades essentially as they did when these markets first started.  
If the floor-based market structures at these exchanges encourage traders to offer liquidity, 
eliminating their floors would be foolish.  However, if other reasons account for the liquidity in 
these markets, switching to electronic trading may be desirable.   
When floor-based trading systems and electronic trading systems compete head-to-head with 
each other, the results have been mixed.  During the 1980’s, the London Stock Exchange was the 
most important market for large French stocks.  In 1989, the Paris Bourse introduced an 
automated electronic trading system.  Since then, much of the trading in French stocks migrated 
from London to Paris.  More recently, the electronic German DTB futures exchange wrested 
trading in German T-bond futures from the floor-based London International Financial Futures 
Exchange (LIFFE).  Neither example, however, provides definitive evidence for or against floor-
based trading because other events have also influenced the outcomes.  The market share of the 
Paris Bourse grew following the 1994 repeal of a French transaction stamp tax which traders 
formerly avoided by trading in London.  Likewise, the German T-bond futures contract moved 
from LIFFE to DTB in response to a coordinated effort by German banks to repatriate their 
market.   
In contrast, brokers, dealers, exchanges, and ECNs have created many automated systems for 
trading NYSE stocks and US equity options.  Some of these systems have been notably 
successful.  Optimark—discussed in the previous chapter—failed spectacularly.  The Arizona 
Stock Exchange proved to be a disappointment to people who believe that markets would benefit 
from electronic call markets.  Instinet, Archipelago, and Island ECN have not taken substantial 
market share from the New York Stock Exchange despite their tremendous success competing 
against the electronic Nasdaq Stock Market.  The electronic International Securities Exchange 
obtained a 16 percent share of US equity option trading in the issues it trades, within 18 months 
of its 2000 launch.  However, it has not yet displaced the traditional floor-based options markets.  
The most successful electronic competitors to the NYSE have been third market dealers, like 
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities and Knight Capital Markets.  Their automated trading 
systems provide very quick service primarily to retail traders represented by discount brokers.  
Floor-based oral auctions and automated rule-based auctions are very similar.  Both are order-
driven markets that match buy orders to sell orders using very similar rules.  Their primary 
difference lies in the technologies they use to arrange these matches.  Traders in oral auctions

arrange trades by personally exchanging information among themselves whereas in automated 
markets, computers arrange the trades.   
Since the two market structures are so similar, exchange officials, regulators, and traders 
naturally consider which is best.  There is no simple answer.  Both structures have strengths and 
weaknesses. 
The Bangladeshi Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange  
In 1999, the Bangladeshi Stock Exchange replaced its trading floor with an automated trading 
system.  At the same time, the New York Stock Exchange considered where to build a new 
trading floor. 
The continued commitment of the New York Stock Exchange to its trading floor may be its most 
important decision at the turn of the millennium.  The members and officers of the Exchange are 
fully aware of its significance.  They believe that the tremendous success of the NYSE is due in 
large part to its floor-based market structure.  They also know that they may lose much, if not all, 
of their franchise if they are wrong.   
 
In this chapter, we consider the arguments for and against these two trading structures.  Our 
discussion examines how they differ in fairness, convenience, capacity, speed, efficiency, and 
cost. 
27.1 Fairness 
Two concepts of market fairness concern traders.  Traders want their markets to operate fairly, 
and they want fair access to those markets.  In operationally fair markets, trading rules are 
uniformly applied, and no cheating occurs.  In fair access markets, all traders have an equal 
chance to take advantage of any opportunities that arise.  
27.1.1 Operational Fairness 
Many traders believe that automated trading systems are the fairest of all market structures.  
Automated systems do only what they are programmed to do.  They implement their trading 
rules exactly and without exception.  They expose orders only as instructed, and only to those 
traders to whom the system permits orders to be exposed. 
In contrast, fairness in oral auctions depends on the skill and honesty of the traders who arrange 
the trades.  Traders must be highly skilled to follow the trading rules faultlessly when the market 
is active, and when prices are moving quickly.  They must honestly follow those rules even when 
doing so may cause them to lose an advantage. 
Although most oral auctions are quite fair, all oral auction markets have suffered from well-
documented trading scandals.  These scandals usually involve front running, inappropriate order 
exposure, fraudulent trade assignment, or prearranged trading by dishonest brokers.   
Although these problems can also arise in automated markets, they cannot take place within their 
automated trading systems.  Instead, dishonest brokers must conduct their frauds on the side.   
Markets prevent these frauds by having officials supervise trading, by investigating suspicious 
trading practices reported by honest traders, and by maintaining—and reviewing—reliable audit

trails.  An audit trail records the submission and disposition of every order.  Good audit trails 
include detailed information about everything that happens to each order.  Regulators use audit 
trails to determine whether traders have violated trading rules.  An accurate audit trail helps keep 
brokers honest. 
Floor-based markets have extensive rules that govern how traders process orders and record 
trades.  Markets design these rules to make the audit trail complete, reliable, and accurate.  These 
rules require traders to time-stamp their orders when they receive them and when they fill them, 
to record trades sequentially, and to report trades immediately. 
Automated trading systems easily produce complete and flawless audit trails of all activity that 
takes place within their systems.  Many traders and regulators especially like these systems for 
this reason. 
What Would You Think? 
Eli needed to roll a 10-contract short futures position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index 
futures from the June to September contracts.  Via the Internet, he submitted a spread order to 
buy 10 June contracts and sell 10 September contracts with a limit of 75, premium to the sell 
side.  The DJIA index futures contracts trade in a pit on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade.  
About a half hour later, Eli queried his broker’s Internet site and discovered that he bought the 
June contracts for 11,060 and sold the September contracts at 11,130.  The 70-point difference 
was less than the 75 points that Eli specified.   
Since the nominal size of the DJIA contract is 10 times the Dow index, each point is worth 10 
dollars per contract.  For ten contracts, the five-point difference between the reported spread and 
the limit represents 500 dollars.  
Eli naturally called his broker and inquired about the discrepancy.  Since the broker did not 
follow his instructions, Eli could have refused to accept the trade, or he could have demanded 
that his broker make up the difference.  The sales broker who answered the phone asked him to 
hold the line while she called the floor to inquire about the problem.  One minute later, she 
reported that the floor incorrectly reported the trade price of the sale.  She said that the 
September contract actually sold for 11,137 so that the spread trade occurred at 77 rather than 70.  
Eli was pleased with the result. 
What really happened?  Consider the following four alternatives: 
A. Somebody incorrectly reported the trade, most probably due to a typo or a transcription error.  
Had Eli not reported the discrepancy, someone would have noted it later, and the broker 
would have properly adjusted Eli’s account.  
B. Somebody incorrectly reported the trade.  Had Eli not reported the discrepancy, the broker 
might have pocketed the difference. 
C. The floor trader executed the trade incorrectly by mistake.  The trader or Eli’s broker made 
up the difference and added two points to keep Eli happy.   
D. The floor trader intentionally executed the trade incorrectly and hoped that Eli would not 
notice the mistake.  The trader or broker made up the difference and added two points to keep 
Eli happy.

Chapter 28 
Bubbles, Crashes, and Circuit Breakers 
Bubbles and crashes occur when prices greatly differ from fundamental values.  The wealth that 
these events create, destroy, and redistribute is often enormous.  Bubbles and crashes thus are 
quite scary when prices change quickly. 
Extreme volatility concerns many people: 
• Traders pay close attention to it because large unexpected price changes expose them to 
tremendous risks and opportunities. 
• Clearinghouses worry about extreme volatility because traders who experience large losses 
may be unable to settle their trades or contracts.  Clearinghouses and their members must 
bear the costs of resulting settlement failures. 
• Exchanges and brokers plan for extreme volatility because extreme price changes usually 
generate—or are generated by—huge volumes that can overwhelm their trading systems and 
cause them to fail.  Large sustained price drops especially concern them because trading 
volumes usually shrink substantially and remain low for a long time afterwards.   
• Microeconomists fret over extreme volatility because very large price changes often appear 
inconsistent with rational pricing and informative prices.  They wonder whether excess price 
volatility causes people to make poor decisions about the use of economic resources. 
• Macroeconomists fear that the wealth effects associated with large, broad-based changes in 
market values may adversely affect the investment and consumption spending decisions that 
companies and individuals make.  Poor spending decisions can cause unsustainable booms 
and protracted contractions in economic activity. 
These concerns explain why market regulators regularly examine trading practices and trading 
rules that might induce or attenuate extreme volatility.  Some policies that they consider can 
create markets that are more resilient.  Other policies have little value, and many policies can 
harm the markets.  Regulators therefore must carefully analyze how market structure affects 
volatility before adopting new policies.  
In this chapter, we consider what causes extreme volatility, and how regulations might make it 
less likely or less dangerous.  Not surprisingly, analysts generally understand the causes of 
extreme volatility better after the fact than beforehand.  Volatility episodes rarely have common 
causes.  They do, however, tend to fit a common pattern.  Traders who can recognize conditions 
that may lead to extreme volatility can take positions that are highly profitable.  Regulators who 
can recognize these conditions can occasionally adopt policies to reduce the harmful aspects of 
extreme volatility. 
We start our discussion by distinguishing among the types and causes of extreme volatility and 
then illustrate these points by considering several examples of bubbles and crashes.  We next 
examine how changes in market structure can affect extreme volatility.  Finally, we briefly 
consider how politics affect regulatory policies taken in response to extreme volatility.

28.1 Bubbles and Crashes 
Bubbles occur when prices rise to levels that are substantially above fundamental values.  
(Fundamental values, of course, are not common knowledge.  If they were, crashes and bubbles 
would not occur.)  Some bubbles occur very quickly.  Others occur over long periods.  Many 
bubbles end with a crash.  Traders say that such bubbles pop. 
Crashes occur when prices fall very quickly.  Crashes often follow bubbles, but they also occur 
in other circumstances.  Crashes sometimes are called market breaks because the price path 
breaks when prices fall very quickly.  They also are called market meltdowns when they overload 
the order handling capacity of a market.   
Bubbles and crashes may affect an individual trading instrument or many instruments at once.  
Those that simultaneously affect many instruments are broad-based events or market-wide 
events.  Very large price changes most commonly affect only an individual instrument.  Broad-
based bubbles and crashes are quite rare. 
28.1.1 Typical Bubble and Crash Dynamics 
Bubbles start when buyers become overly optimistic about fundamental values.  The potential of 
new technologies and the potential growth of new markets can greatly excite some traders.  
Unfortunately, many of these traders cannot recognize when prices already reflect information 
about these potentialities.  They also may not adequately appreciate the risks associated with 
holding the securities that interest them.  If enough of these enthusiastic traders try to buy at the 
same time, they may push prices up substantially.   
The resulting price increases may encourage momentum traders to buy on the hope that past 
gains will continue.  Some momentum traders may buy because they hope to obtain the profits 
that their neighbors and friends have already earned.  If enough traders follow them, they will 
realize their hopes.  The last buyers, however, will lose badly.   
Order anticipators may also buy in anticipation of new uninformed buyers.  They will profit if 
they can get out before prices fall.   
The combined trading of these traders can cause a bubble in which prices exceed fundamental 
values.  Momentum traders and order anticipators, in particular, tend to accelerate price changes.  
Prices also accelerate when early buyers grow more confident as their wealth increases, and 
when early sellers repurchase their positions to stop their losses. 
The Price Accelerator 
Increases in prices transfer wealth from pessimistic traders who have short positions to optimistic 
traders who have long positions.  These transfers can cause accelerate price changes.   
When prices rise, optimistic traders get wealthier.  The most optimistic traders may buy more.  If 
they do, they may cause prices to rise further.  
When prices rise, pessimistic traders lose.  The losses of the most pessimistic traders may force 
them to buy back short positions to cover margin calls.  Their buying may cause prices to rise 
further.

In both cases, the sellers will be traders who do not have such strong opinions.  Mild pessimists 
will sell because the increase in market price makes short positions more attractive.  Mild 
optimists will sell because the increase in market price makes their long positions less attractive.  
Source:  “The Canonical Bubble,” manuscript by Jack Treynor. 
 
Value traders and arbitrageurs may recognize that prices exceed values, but they may be unable 
or unwilling to sell in sufficient volume to prevent the bubble from forming.  These traders may 
be unable to sell as much as they want to sell if they do not have large positions to sell, if they do 
not have enough capital to carry large short positions, or if they cannot easily sell short.  They 
may be unwilling to sell if they suspect that uninformed traders will continue to push prices up, 
or if they lack confidence in their abilities to estimate values well. 
You Believe You Are Right, But …  
(Confidence Is Everything) 
Even when value traders believe that prices greatly differ from fundamental values, they may 
lack the confidence to trade on their opinions.  To trade against the majority opinion requires 
great courage.  Since markets generally aggregate information from diverse sources extremely 
well, value traders must always wonder why they believe that they understand values better than 
everyone else does.  Value traders will not trade unless they are confident that they are right, 
even after considering that the majority of traders think otherwise.  
Value trading is especially difficult when unresolved uncertainties make it impossible for anyone 
to estimate values well.  In which case, value traders will not trade until price is far from their 
estimates of value.  This observation explains why bubbles often form in the stock prices of 
companies that hope to profit from highly promising, but unproven technologies.  
 
Eventually prices rise to a level that causes sellers to start trading aggressively.  The sellers may 
be long-term holders, early buyers who want to realize their gains, contrarians, value traders, or 
arbitrageurs.  Once their selling causes prices to fall, momentum buyers lose their interest.  
Overly optimistic buyers lose their confidence and sellers become more confident.  Late buyers 
especially worry about their positions and often start selling to stop their losses.  Those traders 
who financed their positions on margin may have to sell their positions to satisfy margin calls 
from their brokers.  Other long holders who have placed stop loss orders also will start to sell.  
Order anticipators may anticipate these margin calls and these stop orders and sell before them.  
A crash occurs when the combined effect of all their selling causes prices to quickly fall.   
You Know You Are Right, But …  
(Timing Is Everything) 
Consider the trade timing decisions that value traders must make when they believe that prices 
are too high: 
If they initially have long positions, and they sell them too soon, they will lose the opportunity to 
sell at higher prices as uninformed traders cause prices to continue to rise.   
If they initially have no positions, and they sell short too soon, they initially will lose on their 
short positions.  If they cannot finance their losses, their brokers will force them to buy to cover 
their losses, and they will lose the opportunity to ultimately profit when prices fall.

Chapter 29 
Insider Trading 
Traders engage in insider trading when they base their trades on material information about the 
value of an instrument that is not publicly available.  Most insider trading involves private 
information that corporate managers know about the future prospects of their companies.  Insider 
trading also may involve information that traders improperly obtain from other sources.   
In most countries, insider trading is illegal and is punishable by fines or imprisonment.  Insider-
trading laws are very difficult to enforce, however.  Only a few countries—primarily the United 
States, Canada, and Britain—regularly and seriously attempt to enforce their insider-trading 
laws.   
Insider trading has many economic effects.  In the financial markets, it affects investor 
confidence, price efficiency, and liquidity.  In the overall economy, insider trading affects the 
labor market for senior corporate managers, and the quality of management decisions that these 
executives make.   
In this chapter, we define insider trading and explain how regulators enforce insider-trading 
laws.  We then consider the debate over whether to restrict insider trading.  As we debate the two 
sides of the issue, we will identify the effects that insider trading has on the markets and on the 
overall economy.   
If you trade, you must recognize insider information to avoid making illegal trades.  More 
generally, you must understand insider trading to fully understand market liquidity.  Finally, and 
perhaps most unexpectedly, you must understand the effects of insider trading on managerial 
labor markets to fairly interpret comparisons of senior executive compensation across countries. 
29.1 Inside Information and Insider Trading 
Insider trading and inside information are hard to define.  Both are complex legal concepts that 
are subject to substantial interpretation.  If you are confronted with an issue that may involve 
insider trading, you should consult a competent attorney.  
An SEC Definition of Insider Trading 
Statuary laws, the government regulations that implement them, and the case law created by 
successful and unsuccessful attempts to prosecute inside traders define insider trading.  As a 
public service, the US Securities and Exchange Commission provides a one paragraph summary 
definition of insider trading on its web pages: 
 “Insider trading” refers generally to buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary 
duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in possession of material, 
nonpublic information about the security.  Insider trading violations may also include 
“tipping” such information, securities trading by the person “tipped” and securities 
trading by those who misappropriate such information.  Examples of insider trading cases 
that have been brought by the Commission are cases against: corporate officers, directors, 
and employees who traded the corporation's securities after learning of significant, 
confidential corporate developments; friends, business associates, family members, and

other “tippees” of such officers, directors, and employees, who traded the securities after 
receiving such information; employees of law, banking, brokerage and printing firms 
who were given such information in order to provide services to the corporation whose 
securities they traded; government employees who learned of such information because 
of their employment by the government; and other persons who misappropriated, and 
took advantage of, confidential information from their employers. 
This one paragraph summary nicely illustrates the complexity of the law on insider trading.  
Source:  www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/insider.htm (January 4, 2002) 
 
The primary purpose of this chapter is to help you understand the economic issues that surround 
insider trading.  For this purpose, we define inside information as material information about the 
value of a security that is not available to public traders.  Material information is information 
that would cause prices to change if it were widely known.  In the equity markets, corporate 
managers control most inside information.   
In jurisdictions that prohibit insider trading, nobody can trade on inside information until after 
the information is publicly available.  In particular, corporate managers cannot trade on the 
information nor can their friends nor can the friends of their friends.  Inside information 
generally retains its status regardless of how many people have passed it.  You may not trade on 
a stock tip that you receive from your barber who received it from another client who received it 
from a corporate insider, if the tip is based on inside information.  Inside information loses its 
special status only when it becomes available to the public.  After a firm releases information to 
the public through a broadly distributed press release or through a public filing, the information 
is publicly available.   
Texas Gulf Sulfur 
In late 1963, Texas Gulf Sulfur discovered very valuable deposits on copper, zinc, and silver in 
Ontario.  Between November 12, 1962 and April 16, 1964, officers, directors, employees, and 
their friends bought Texas Gulf Sulfur stock and call options.  During this period, the stock price 
rose from 173/8 to 293/8 dollars.   
The company, however, did not disclose information about the find until April 12, 1964.  On that 
date, it merely revealed that its drilling had “not been conclusive” and that “the rumors about the 
discovery were unreliable … premature and possibly misleading.”  Four days later, on April 16, 
the company announced a major ore discovery.  Following the announcement, the stock price 
rose to 71 dollars.  
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued various directors, managers, and employees of 
Texas Gulf Sulfur alleging insider trading and deliberate efforts to mislead the public.  The suit 
was successful.

of Atlanta Economic Review, Fourth Quarter 1997, p. 36.  
 
Sometimes, information that traders do not obtain directly from management is inside 
information.  For example, suppose that a financial printer prints a prospectus for a takeover 
offer.  While operating the presses, a pressman reads the copy and calls a friend to tell him to 
buy the target.  The friend will be trading on insider information.

Vincent Chiarella, the Printer 
In 1975 and 1976, Vincent Chiarella worked as a "markup man" in the New York composing 
room of Pandick Press, a financial printer.  Among the documents that he handled were five 
announcements of corporate takeover bids.  When these documents were delivered to the printer, 
the identities of the acquiring and target corporations were concealed by blank spaces or false 
names.  The true names were sent to the printer on the night of the final printing. 
Chiarella, however, was able to deduce the names of the target companies before the final 
printing from other information contained in the documents.  Without disclosing his knowledge, 
he purchased stock in the target companies and sold the shares immediately after the takeover 
attempts were made public.  By this method, Chiarella realized a gain of slightly more than 
30,000 dollars in the course of 14 months.  Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission began an investigation of his trading activities.  In May 1977, Chiarella entered into 
a consent decree with the SEC in which he agreed to return his profits to the sellers of the shares.  
On the same day, Pandick Press discharged him.  
Chiarella was later convicted of 17 counts of violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (1934 Act) and SEC Rule 10b-5 under the principle that Chiarella owed a 
responsibility to the sellers to disclose his information.  In 1980, the US Supreme Court reversed 
the conviction because he had no fiduciary duty to the acquiring or target firms.   
The law has subsequently changed.  If Chiarella were brought to trial now, he would be 
convicted of insider trading because he misappropriated information.  
Source:  The first two paragraphs of this box are taken almost verbatim from Section I of the Supreme Court 
decision in Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222 (1980).  The decision appears at 
caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=445&invol=222. 
 
Managers must control the dissemination of material information.  In particular, they must either 
keep it secret or widely distribute it.  When they distribute confidential information to business 
associates, they must execute confidentiality agreements.  If managers distribute inside 
information to their friends who then trade upon it, the managers risk prosecution. 
A Noble Cause and a Base Explanation 
In Fall 2000, the US Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Regulation FD.  This 
regulation requires that “whenever an issuer … discloses any material nonpublic information 
regarding that issuer or its securities to any person …, the issuer shall make public disclosure of 
that information … simultaneously, in the case of an intentional disclosure; and promptly, in the 
case of a non-intentional disclosure.” 
Before the adoption of Regulation FD, corporations would frequently tell their analysts material 
information before they reported it to the public.  The analysts, their clients, or both would then 
trade on this information.   
Not surprisingly, analysts adamantly opposed the new regulation.  They claimed that it would 
make security prices less informative.  In particular, they argued that their reports would be 
much less informative if they could not privately interview management and ask them probing 
questions.  Without this privilege, they claimed that they would not be able to discover 
incompetent or dishonest management.

Bibliography 
 
This bibliography provides selected references for further reading.  I classified the references 
using the chapter outline of this book.  Since some articles and books cover topics that appear in 
many of the chapters, the classification is somewhat arbitrary.   
The market microstructure literature has grown large very quickly.  This bibliography therefore 
is not comprehensive.  I included many works because they provide the first clear presentation of 
a principle or because they include extensive bibliographies of their topics.  I included other 
works because I especially appreciated what I learned from them or because I found them to be 
particularly well written.   
I undoubtedly failed to include many excellent works simply because I did not remember them.  
Although I am blessed with an excellent memory for ideas, I regrettably have a poor memory for 
names.  The omission of many excellent works from this bibliography therefore reflects more on 
me than on them.
