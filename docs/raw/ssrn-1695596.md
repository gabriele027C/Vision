Flow Toxicity and Liquidity in a High Frequency World 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Order flow is toxic when it adversely selects market makers, who may be unaware they are 
providing liquidity at a loss. We present a new procedure to estimate flow toxicity based on 
volume imbalance and trade intensity (the VPIN toxicity metric). VPIN is updated in volume-
time, making it applicable to the high frequency world, and it does not require the intermediate 
estimation of non-observable parameters or the application of numerical methods. It does require 
trades classified as buys or sells, and we develop a new bulk volume classification procedure that 
we argue is more useful in high frequency markets than standard classification procedures. We 
show that the VPIN metric is a useful indicator of short-term, toxicity-induced volatility. 
 
Keywords: Flash crash, liquidity, flow toxicity, volume imbalance, market microstructure,

Flow Toxicity and Liquidity in a High Frequency World 
 
 
High frequency (HF) trading firms represent approximately 2% of the nearly 20,000 
trading firms operating in the U.S. markets, but since 2009 they have accounted for over 70% of 
the volume in U.S. equity markets and are fast approaching 50% of the volume in futures 
markets (Iati [2009], CFTC [2010]). These HF firms typically act as market makers, providing 
liquidity to position-takers by placing passive orders at various levels of the electronic order 
book. A passive order is defined as an order that does not cross the market, thus the originator 
has no direct control on the timing of its execution. HF market makers generally do not make 
directional bets, but rather strive to earn tiny margins on large numbers of trades. Their ability to 
do so depends on limiting their position risk, which is greatly affected by their ability to control 
adverse selection in the execution of their passive orders. 
Practitioners usually refer to adverse selection as the “natural tendency for passive 
orders to fill quickly when they should fill slowly and fill slowly (or not at all) when they should 
fill quickly” (Jeria and Sofianos [2008]). This intuitive formulation is consistent with market 
microstructure models (see Glosten and Milgrom [1985], Kyle [1985], and Easley and O’Hara 
[1987, 1992]), in which informed traders take advantage of uninformed traders. Order flow is 
regarded as toxic when it adversely selects market makers who may be unaware that they are 
providing liquidity at a loss.  
This paper develops a new framework for measuring order flow toxicity in a high 
frequency world. A fundamental insight of the microstructure literature is that the order arrival 
process is informative for subsequent price moves in general, and flow’s toxicity in particular. 
Extracting this information from order flow, however, is complicated by the very nature of

trading in high frequency markets. We argue that in the high frequency world, trade-time, as 
captured by volume, is a more relevant metric than clock-time. Information is also different, 
relating now to an underlying event that induces unbalanced or accelerated trade over a relatively 
short horizon. Information events can arise for a variety of reasons, some related to asset returns, 
but others reflecting more systemic or portfolio-based effects. Our particular application is to 
futures contracts, where information is more likely to be related to systemic factors, or to 
variables reflecting hedging or other portfolio considerations. 
We present a new procedure to estimate flow toxicity directly and analytically, based on 
a process subordinated to volume arrival, which we name Volume-Synchronized Probability of 
Informed Trading, or the VPIN flow toxicity metric. The original PIN estimation approach (see 
Easley, Kiefer, O’Hara and Paperman [1996]) entailed maximum likelihood estimation of 
unobservable parameters fitted on a mixture of three Poisson distributions of daily buys and sells 
on stocks. That static approach was extended by the Easley, Engle, O’Hara and Wu [2008] 
GARCH specification, which models a time-varying arrival rate of informed and uninformed 
traders. The approached based on the VPIN toxicity metric developed in this paper does not 
require the intermediate numerical estimation of non-observable parameters, and is updated in 
stochastic time which is calibrated to have an equal volume of trade in each time interval. Thus, 
our methodology overcomes the difficulties of estimating PIN models in highly active markets 
and provides an analytically tractable way to measure the toxicity of order flow using high 
frequency data. 
We provide empirical evidence on the statistical properties of the VPIN metric. We show 
how volume bucketing (time intervals selected so that each has an equal volume of trade) 
reduces the impact of volatility clustering in the sample.1 Because large price moves are

associated with large volumes, sampling by volume is a proxy for sampling by volatility.2 The 
resulting time series of observations follows a distribution that is closer to normal and is less 
heteroskedastic than it would be if it were sampled uniformly in clock-time.  
We illustrate the usefulness of the VPIN metric by estimating it for the E-mini S&P 500 
futures (CME) and the WTI crude oil futures contract (NYMEX). We also demonstrate that 
VPIN has important linkages with future price variability.  Because toxicity is harmful to 
liquidity providers, high levels of VPIN should presage high volatility.  We show that VPIN 
predicts short-term toxicity-induced volatility, particularly as it relates to large price moves. 
An incidental contribution of this paper is a new approach for classifying buy and sell 
volume.  The speed and volume of trading in high frequency markets challenges traditional 
classification schemes for assigning trade direction.  We propose a new “bulk volume” 
classification algorithm in which we aggregate trades over short time or volume intervals 
(respectively denoted time bars and volume bars) and then use the standardized price change 
between the beginning and end of the interval to approximate the percentage of buy and sell 
volume.  We believe this new approach will be useful for a wide variety of applications in high 
frequency markets. 
Estimates of the toxicity of order flow have a number of immediate applications. Market 
makers, for example, can use the VPIN metric as a real-time risk management tool. In other 
research (see Easley, López de Prado, and O’Hara [2011a]), we presented evidence that order 
flow as captured by the VPIN metric was becoming increasingly toxic in the hours before the 
May 6th 2010 ‘flash crash’, and that this toxicity contributed to the withdrawal of many liquidity 
providers from the market.3 Tracking the VPIN metric would allow market makers to control 
their risk and potentially remain active in volatile markets. Regulators and exchanges could use

the VPIN metric to monitor the conditions under which liquidity is provided, and pro-actively 
restrict trading or impose market controls if conditions deteriorate to the point that liquidity 
provision is threatened.4 In a high frequency world, effective regulation needs to be done on an 
ex-ante basis, anticipating problems before, and not after, they lead to market breakdowns. 
Monitoring VPIN metric levels can signal when liquidity provision is at risk and allow for 
market halts, slowdowns or other regulatory actions to forestall crashes. Furthermore, this will 
limit the success of predatory algorithms that attempt to profit from a failure of the liquidity 
provision process. Traders can also use measures based on the VPIN metric in designing 
algorithms to control execution risks. Microstructure models have long noted (see, for example, 
Admati and Pfleiderer [1988]) that intra-day seasonalities can reflect the varying participation 
rates of informed and uninformed traders. Designing algorithms to delay or accelerate trading 
depending on the VPIN metric may reduce the so- called implementation shortfall. 
Our analysis of order toxicity and its effects in high frequency markets is related to a 
growing body of recent research looking at high frequency trading in a multiplicity of markets. 
Hendershott and Riordan [2009] present evidence on HF trading on the Deutsche Borse; 
Brodegaard [2010] and Hasbrouck and Saar [2010] analyze the role and strategies of high 
frequency traders in U.S. equity markets. Kirilenko, Kyle, Samadi and Tuzun [2010] extensively 
characterize the behavior of HF traders and other market participants in the S&P 500 futures 
market. There is also a developing literature looking at the more normative effects of 
computerized or HF trading on liquidity. Hendershott, Jones and Menkveld [2011] study the 
empirical relationship between algorithmic trading and liquidity, finding that algorithmic trading 
improves liquidity for large stocks. Chaboud, Chiquoine, Hjalmarsson, and Vega [2009] provide 
a similar analysis of the effects of computerized trading in foreign exchange. These analyses

complement recent theoretical research looking at the relation between liquidity and market 
fragility (see Brunnermeir and Pedersen [2009] and Huang and Wang [2011]). 
Methodologically, this paper is related to research by Engle and Lange [2001] and 
Deuskar and Johnson [2011]. Engle and Lange proposed a market depth measure, VNET, which 
is calculated using order imbalance measured over price change increments.  Our analysis is 
calculated over volume increments (or buckets), but both their analysis and ours depart from 
standard time-based approaches to analyze the effects of asymmetric information in dynamic 
market environments. Deuskar and Johnson also analyze order flow imbalance in futures 
markets. These authors estimate the flow-driven component of systematic risk and its dynamic 
properties. Our focus is not on asset pricing issues, but their finding that flow-driven risk 
accounts for over half of the risk in the market portfolio underscores our argument that order 
flow imbalance (a source of toxicity) has important effects on market behaviour and 
performance. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 discusses the theoretical framework and 
shows how PIN impacts the bid-ask spread. Section 2 presents our procedure for estimating the 
VPIN metric. Section 3 evaluates the robustness of the VPIN metric. Section 4 provides 
estimates of the VPIN metric for equity indices and oil futures. Section 5 discusses predictive 
properties of the VPIN metric for volatility. Section 6 summarizes our findings. Technical 
Appendices (available on the RFS web site) present the pseudocode for computing the VPIN 
toxicity metric, and its Monte Carlo accuracy.

1.  THE MODEL 
In this section we describe the basic model that allows us to infer the toxicity of order 
flow. We begin with a standard microstructure model in which we derive our measure of flow 
toxicity, PIN, and we then show how to modify PIN to apply it to high frequency markets. 
Readers conversant with the standard PIN approach can proceed directly to Section 2. 
In a series of papers, Easley et. al. demonstrate how a microstructure model can be 
estimated for individual stocks using trade data to determine the probability of information-based 
trading, PIN. This microstructure model views trading as a game between liquidity providers and 
traders (position takers) that is repeated over trading periods i=1,…,I. At the beginning of each 
period, nature chooses whether an information event occurs. These events occur independently 
with probability . If the information is good news, then informed traders know that by the end 
of the trading period the asset will be worthSi; and, if the information is bad news, that it will be 
worth Si, with 
i
i

S

. Good news occurs with probability (1-) and bad news occurs with the 
remaining probability, . After an information event occurs or does not occur, trading for the 
period begins with traders arriving according to Poisson processes throughout the trading period. 
During periods with an information event, orders from informed traders arrive at rate . These 
informed traders buy if they have seen good news, and sell if they have seen bad news. Every 
period, orders from uninformed buyers and uninformed sellers each arrive at rate .5 
The structural model relates observable market outcomes (i.e. buys and sells) to the 
unobservable information and order processes that underlie trading. The previous literature 
focuses on estimating the parameters determining these processes via maximum likelihood. 
Intuitively, the model interprets the normal level of buys and sells in a stock as uninformed trade, 
and it uses that data to identify the rate of uninformed order flow, . Abnormal buy or sell

volume is interpreted as information-based trade, and it is used to identify . The number of 
periods in which there is abnormal buy or sell volume is used to identify  and .  
A liquidity provider uses his knowledge of these parameters to determine the price at 
which he is willing to go long, the Bid, and the price at which he is willing to go short, the Ask. 
These prices differ, and so there is a Bid-Ask Spread, because the liquidity provider does not 
know whether the counterparty to his trade is informed or not. This spread is the difference in the 
expected value of the asset conditional on someone buying from the liquidity provider and the 
expected value of the asset conditional on someone selling to the liquidity provider. These 
conditional expectations differ because of the adverse selection problem induced by the possible 
presence of better informed traders.  
As trade progresses, liquidity providers observe trades and are modeled as if they use 
Bayes rule to update their beliefs about the toxicity of the order flow, which in our model is 
described by the parameter estimates. Let P(t) = (Pn(t), Pb(t), Pg(t)) be a liquidity provider’s 
belief about the events “no news” (n), “bad news” (b), and “good news” (g) at time t. His belief 
at time 0 is P(0) = (1-, (1-)).  
To determine the Bid or Ask at time t, the liquidity provider updates his beliefs 
conditional on the arrival of an order of the relevant type. The time t expected value of the asset, 
conditional on the history of trade prior to time t, is

where   
              is the prior expected value of the asset. 
The Bid is the expected value of the asset conditional on someone wanting to sell the 
asset to a liquidity provider. So it is

Similarly, the Ask is the expected value of the asset conditional on someone wanting to 
buy the asset from a liquidity provider. So it is 
              
      
                      
(3) 
 
These equations demonstrate the explicit role played by arrivals of informed and 
uninformed traders in affecting quotes. If there are no informed traders (= 0), then trade carries 
no information, and so the Bid and Ask are both equal to the prior expected value of the asset. 
Alternatively, if there are no uninformed traders (=0), then the Bid and Ask are at the minimum 
and maximum prices, respectively. At these prices no informed traders will trade either, and the 
market, in effect, shuts down. Generally, both informed and uninformed traders will be in the 
market, and so the Bid is less than          and the Ask is greater than        . 
The Bid-Ask Spread at time t is denoted by (t) = A(t) – B(t). This spread is 
     
      
                      
      
                      
(4) 
 
The first term in the spread equation is the probability that a buy is an information-based 
trade times the expected loss to an informed buyer, and the second is a symmetric term for sells. 
The spread for the initial quotes in the period, , has a particularly simple form in the natural 
case in which good and bad events are equally likely. That is, if  = 1- then

The key component of this model is the probability that an order is from an informed 
trader, which is called PIN. It is straightforward to show that the probability that the opening 
trade in a period is information-based is given by 
    
  
      
(6) 
 
where  + 2 is the arrival rate for all orders and  is the arrival rate for information-based 
orders. PIN is thus a measure of the fraction of orders that arise from informed traders relative to 
the overall order flow, and the spread equation shows that it is the key determinant of spreads. 
These equations illustrate the idea that liquidity providers need to correctly estimate PIN 
in order to identify the optimal levels at which to enter the market. An unanticipated increase in 
PIN will result in losses to those liquidity providers who don’t adjust their prices. 
 
2.  THE VPIN METRIC AND THE ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS 
The standard approach to computing the PIN model uses maximum likelihood to estimate 
the unobservable parameters           driving the stochastic process of trades and then derives 
PIN from these parameter estimates. In this section, we propose a direct analytic estimation of 
toxicity that does not require intermediate numerical estimation of non-observable parameters. 
We update our measure in volume-time in an attempt to match the speed of arrival of new 
information to the marketplace. This volume-based approach, which we term VPIN, provides a 
simple metric for measuring order toxicity in a high frequency environment.  First, we begin 
with a discussion of the role of information and time in high frequency trading.

2.1.  The Nature of Information and Time 
Information in the standard sequential trade model is generally viewed as data that is 
informative about the future value of the asset.  In an equity market setting it is natural to view 
information as being about future events such as the prospects of the company or the market for 
its products.  In an efficient market, the value of the asset should converge to its full information 
value as informed traders seek to profit on their information by trading.  Because market makers 
can be long or short the stock, future movements in the value of the asset affect their profitability 
and so they attempt to infer any underlying new information from the patterns of trade.  It is their 
updated beliefs that are impounded into their bid and ask prices. 
In a high frequency world, market makers face the same basic problem, although the 
horizon under which they operate changes things in interesting ways.  A high frequency market 
maker who anticipates holding the stock for minutes is affected by information that influences its 
value over that interval.  This information may be related to underlying asset fundamentals, but it 
may also reflect factors related to the nature of trading in the overall market or to the specifics of 
liquidity demand over a particular interval.  For example, in a futures contract, information that 
induces increased hedging demand for a contract will generally influence the futures price, and 
so is relevant for a market maker.  This broader definition of information means that information 
events may occur frequently during the day, and they may have varying importance for the 
magnitude of future price movements.  Nonetheless, their existence is still signaled by the nature 
and timing of trades. 
The most important aspect of high frequency modeling is that trades are not equally 
spaced in terms of time.6 Trades arrive at irregular frequency, and some trades are more 
important than others as they reveal differing amounts of information. For example, as Figure 1

shows, trading in E-mini S&P 500 futures (the blue curve and scale on the left side of the graph) 
and EUR/USD futures (the red curve and scale on the right side of the graph) exhibit a different 
intraday seasonality. The arrival of new information to the marketplace triggers waves of 
decisions that translate into volume bursts. Information relevant to different products arrives at 
different times, thus generating distinct intraday volume seasonalities. 
[FIGURE 1 HERE] 
In this study, rather than modeling clock-time, we work in volume-time. Easley and 
O’Hara [1992] developed the idea that the time between trades was correlated with the existence 
of new information, providing our basis for looking at trade time instead of clock time.7  It seems 
reasonable that the more relevant a piece of news is, the more volume it attracts. By drawing a 
sample every occasion the market exchanges a constant amount of volume, we attempt to mimic 
the arrival to the market of news of comparable relevance. If a particular piece of news generates 
twice as much volume as another piece of news, we will draw twice as many observations, thus 
doubling its weight in the sample.  
 
2.2.  Volume Bucketing 
In the example above, if we draw one E-mini S&P 500 futures sample every 200,000 
traded contracts, we will draw on average about 9 samples per day. On very active days, we draw 
a large multiple of 9, while inactive days contribute fewer data points. Since the EUR/USD 
futures contract trades about 1/10 of E-mini S&P 500 futures’ daily volume on average, targeting 
9 draws per day will require reducing the volume-distance between two observations to about 
20,000 contracts. Because of their differing intra-day patterns of trade, by the time we draw our

<!-- PAGE 14 -->

14 
 
first E-mini S&P 500 futures observation of the day, we are about to draw our fourth observation 
of the day for the EUR/USD futures. 
To implement this volume dependent sampling, we group sequential trades into equal 
volume buckets of an exogenously defined size V. A volume bucket is a collection of trades with 
total volume V. If the last trade needed to complete a bucket is for a size greater than required, 
the excess size is given to the next bucket. We let τ=1,…,n be the index of equal volume buckets. 
A detailed algorithm for this volume packaging process is presented in the Appendix. Sampling 
by volume buckets allows us to divide the trading session into periods of comparable information 
content over which trade imbalances have a meaningful economic impact on the liquidity 
providers. 
 
2.3.  Buy Volume and Sell Volume Classification 
An issue we have not yet addressed is how to distinguish buy volume and sell volume.8 
Recall that signed volume is necessary because of its potential correlation with order toxicity. 
While the overall level of volume signals the possible presence of new information, the direction 
of the volume signals its implications for the direction of price changes. Thus, a preponderance 
of buy (sell) volume would suggest toxicity arising from the presence of good (bad) news. 
Microstructure research has relied on tick-based algorithms to sign trades. Trade 
classification, however, has always been problematic.  One problem is that reporting conventions 
in markets could treat orders differently depending upon whether they were buys or sells. The 
NYSE, for example, would report only one trade if a large sell block crossed against multiple 
buy orders on the book, but would report multiple trades if it were a large buy block crossing 
against multiple sell orders. Similarly, splitting large orders into multiple small orders meant that

<!-- PAGE 15 -->

15 
 
trades occurring in short intervals were not in fact independent observations. Aggregating trades 
on the same side of the market over short intervals into a single observation was the convention 
empirical researchers used to deal with these problems.  
A second difficulty is that signing trades also requires relating the trade price to the 
prevailing quote. Traders taking the market maker’s bid (ask) were presumed to be sellers 
(buyers), and trades falling in between were signed using a tick-based algorithm. The Lee-Ready 
[1991] algorithm also suggested using a 5 second delay between the reported quote and trade 
price to reflect the fact that the mechanism reporting quotes to the tape was not the same as the 
trade-reporting mechanism. Even in the simpler world of specialist trading, trade classification 
errors were substantial. 
In a high frequency setting, trade classification is much more difficult. In the futures 
markets we investigate, there is no specialist, and liquidity arises from an electronic order book 
containing limit orders placed by a variety of traders. In this electronic market, a trader could hit 
the book at the same level as the last trade or could submit a limit order that improves the last 
traded price, and the tick rule can assign the wrong side to the trade.9 Additionally, order 
splitting is the norm, cancellations of quotes and orders are rampant, and the sheer volume of 
trades is overwhelming.10 Using E-mini S&P 500 futures data from May 2010, we found that an 
average day featured 2,650,391 quote changes due to order additions or cancellations, and 
789,676 quote changes due to trades. Because the Best-Bid-or-Offer (BBO) changes several 
times between trades, many contracts exchanged at the same price in fact occurred against the 
bid and the offer. In this high frequency world, applying standard algorithms over individual 
transactions is problematic.

In our analysis, we aggregate trades over short intervals and then use the standardized 
price change between the beginning and end of the interval to determine the percentage of buy 
and sell volume.11 Aggregation mitigates the effects of order splitting, and using the standardized 
price change allows volume classification in probabilistic terms (which we call bulk 
classification). In this particular paper, we calculate buy and sell volumes (    and    ) using 
one-minute time bars (we show later that our analysis works equally well with other time 
aggregations), but the analysis can also be done using volume bars.12 Let

where      is the index of the last time bar included in the τ volume bucket, Z is the CDF of the 
standard normal distribution and     is the estimate of the standard derivation of price changes 
between time bars. Our procedure splits the volume in a time bar equally between buy and sell 
volume if there is no price change from the beginning to the end of the time bar. Alternatively, if 
the price increases, the volume is weighted more toward buys than sells and the weighting 
depends on how large the price change is relative to the distribution of price changes. 
A key difference between bulk classification and the Lee-Ready algorithm is that the 
latter signs volume as either buy or sell, whilst the former signs a fraction of the volume as buys 
and the remainder as sells.13 In other words, the Lee-Ready algorithm provides a discrete 
classification, while the bulk algorithm is continuous. This means that even in the extreme case 
that a single time bar fills a volume bucket, volume may still be perfectly balanced according to 
bulk classification (contingent on 
       
   ).

Our primary use of volume is to compute order imbalance. Let               be the 
order imbalance in volume bucket τ. Our measure is, of course, an approximation to actual order 
imbalance as it is based on our probabilistic volume classification. We first ask how        
relates to the rate of trading by showing that it is unaffected by a simple rescaling of trading. 
Suppose that each time bar’s volume is rescaled by a factor of    ,   
     , and that volume 
imbalance is homogeneously distributed within the bucket.14 Then the expected number of time 
bars required to fill a bucket will be inversely proportional to  , 
           
 
. From Eq. (7), this 
leaves the expected order imbalance,       , unaltered, 
                        
                       
(8) 
 
Second, we ask whether, within reasonable bounds, the amount of time contained in a 
time bar effects our measure of order imbalance? To determine this, we computed order 
imbalance for the E-mini S&P 500, for the period January 1,  2008 to August 1,  2011, using 
time bars ranging from 1 to 240 minutes per time bar. For each specification of a time bar we use 
50 volume buckets per day and compute the ratio of order imbalance to the bucket size as 
measured by the volume in each bucket. We found that the ratio of order imbalance to bucket 
size (as a function of the average number of time bars per bucket) increases gradually as the 
number of time bars per bucket declines, never approaching one and eventually levels off as we 
use (unreasonable) long  time bars.15  Thus, for time bars of reasonable length the amount of time 
in a time bar is of little consequence in measuring the order imbalance. 
This methodology will misclassify some volume. Our goal is not to classify correctly 
each individual trade (a hopeless exercise in any case), but rather to develop an indicator of 
overall trade imbalance that is useful for creating a measure of toxicity. We use time bars to

allow time for the market price to adjust to the trade direction information that we attempt to 
recover through bulk classification. Later in the paper we present evidence that our bulk 
classification procedure leads to more useful results for the purposes of estimating flow toxicity 
than those based on the itemized classification of raw transaction data.16  
 
2.4.  Volume-Synchronized Probability Of Informed Trading (the VPIN Flow 
Toxicity Metric) 
 
The standard PIN model looks only at the number of buys and sells to infer knowledge 
about the underlying information structure; there is no explicit role for volume. In the high 
frequency markets we analyze, the number of trades is problematic. Going back to the theoretical 
foundation for PIN, what we ultimately want is information about trading intentions that arise 
from informed or uninformed traders. The link between these trading intentions and transactions 
data is very noisy as trading intentions may be split into many pieces to minimize market impact, 
one order may produce many trade executions, and information-based trades may be done in 
various order forms. For these reasons, we treat each reported trade as if it were an aggregation 
of trades of unit size (i.e. a trade for five contracts at some price p is treated as if it were five 
trades of one contract each at price p). This convention explicitly puts trade intensity into the 
analysis.  
 
We know from Easley, Engle, O’Hara and Wu [2008] that for each period the expected 
trade imbalance is                 and that the expected total number of trades is

. Volume bucketing allows us to estimate this specification very simply.  
In particular, recall that we divide the trading day into equal-sized volume buckets and treat each 
volume bucket as equivalent to a period for information arrival. That means that   
    
  is

constant, and it is equal to V, for all τ. We then approximate expected trade imbalance by average 
trade imbalance over n buckets. 
From the values computed above, we can write the Volume-Synchronized Probability of 
Informed Trading, the VPIN flow toxicity metric, as17 
     
  
       
         
 
   
  
 
(9) 
 
Estimating the VPIN metric requires choosing V, the volume in every bucket, and n, the 
number of buckets used to approximate the expected trade imbalance. As an initial specification, 
we focus on V equal to one-fiftieth of the average daily volume. If we then choose n=50, we will 
calculate the VPIN metric over 50 buckets, which on a day of average volume would correspond 
to finding a daily VPIN.   Our results are robust to a wide range of choices of V and n as we 
discuss in Section 5. 
The VPIN metric is updated after each volume bucket.  Thus, when bucket 51 is filled, 
we drop bucket 1 and calculate the new VPIN based on buckets 2 – 51. We update the VPIN 
metric in volume-time for two reasons. First, we want the speed at which we update VPIN to 
mimic the speed at which information arrives to the marketplace. We use volume as a proxy for 
the arrival of information to accomplish this goal. Second, we would like each update to be based 
on a comparable amount of information. Volume can be very imbalanced during segments of the 
trading session with low participation, and in such low-volume segments it seems unlikely that 
there is new information. So updating the VPIN metric in clock-time would lead to updates 
based on heterogeneous amounts of information.  
As an example, consider the trading of the E-mini S&P 500 futures on May 6th 2010. 
Volume on this date (remembered for the “flash crash” that took place) was extremely high, so

<!-- PAGE 20 -->

20 
 
our procedure produces 137 estimations of the VPIN metric, compared to the average 50 daily 
estimations. Because our sample length (n) is also 50, the time range used for some estimations 
of the VPIN metric on May 6th 2010 was only a few hours, compared to the average 24 hours. 
[FIGURE 2 HERE] 
Figure 2 illustrates the way time ranges become “elastic”, contingent on the trade 
intensity (a proxy for speed of information arrival). At 9:30 am (EST), the data used to compute 
VPIN covered almost an entire day. But as the New York Stock Exchange opened on May 6th 
2010, our algorithm updated the VPIN metric more frequently and based its estimates on a 
shorter interval of clock-time. By 12:17pm, VPIN was being computed looking back only one-
half of a day. Note how reducing the time period covered by the sample did not lead to noisier 
estimations. On the contrary, the VPIN metric kept changing following a continuous trend. The 
reason is that time ranges do not contain comparable amounts of information. Instead, it is 
volume ranges that produce comparable amounts of information per update.18 
GARCH specifications provide an alternative way to deal with the volatility clustering 
typical of high frequency data sampled in clock-time. Working in volume-time reduces the 
impact of volatility clustering, since we produce estimates based on samples of equal volume. 
Because large price moves are associated with large volumes, sampling by volume can be 
viewed as a proxy for sampling by volatility. The result is a collection of observations whose 
distribution is closer to normal and is less heteroskedastic than it would be if we sampled 
uniformly in clock-time. Thus, working in volume-time can be viewed as a simple alternative to 
employing a GARCH specification. 
To see how this transformation allows a partial recovery of normality, we consider an E-
mini S&P 500 futures 1-minute bars sample from January 1, 2008 to August 1, 2011. We draw

an average of 50 price observations a day, equally spaced by time in the first case (chronological 
time), and equally spaced by volume in the second (volume time). Next, we compute first order 
differences and standardize each sample. Both samples are negatively skewed and have fat tails, 
but the volume-time sample is much closer to normal, exhibits less serial correlation, and is less 
heteroskedastic. This becomes more obvious as the sampling frequency increases (compare 
tables for 50 and 100 draws per day). Table 1 gives the resulting statistics and Figure 3 provides 
a graphical illustration of the normalized price changes. 
[TABLE 1 HERE] 
[FIGURE 3 HERE] 
 
3.  THE STABILITY OF VPIN ESTIMATES 
Estimating the VPIN volatility metric involves a variety of specification issues.  In this 
section, we show robustness of the VPIN measure to two of the most important of these issues, 
namely, alternative volume classification schemes and changes in the transaction record. Our 
calculations are based on the E-mini S&P 500 futures series of 1-minute bars, from January 1st 
2008 to August 15th 2011, for a bucket size consistent with an average of 50 volume buckets per 
day, and a sample length of 50 buckets. 
 
3.1.  Stability Under Different Volume Classification Schemes 
 
The choice of how to classify volume has an important effect on the estimate of VPIN. In 
particular, because VPIN involves looking at trade imbalance and intensity, aggregating over 
time bars would be expected to reduce the noise in this variable as well as to rescale it.  In 
Easley, López de Prado, and O’Hara [2011a], we argued that this necessitates looking at the

<!-- PAGE 22 -->

22 
 
relative levels of VPIN as captured by their cumulative distribution function rather than at 
absolute levels of VPIN.19   
This point can be illustrated by looking at the behavior of VPIN on a given day for 
different volume classification algorithms.  The “flash crash” on May 6 is of particular 
importance in futures (and equity) markets and so we illustrate the behavior of VPIN on this day 
using three alternative volume classification schemes.  Figure 4(a) shows VPIN calculated using 
bulk classification of 1-minute time bars; 4(b) uses bulk classification of 10-second bars; and 
4(c) uses Lee-Ready trade-by-trade classification. 
[FIGURE 4 (a), (b), (c) HERE] 
The three methods concur in signaling an extreme level for the VPIN flow toxicity metric 
at least two hours before the crash (see the CDF(VPIN) dashed line crossing the 0.9 threshold).20 
The 1-minute and 10-second time bars produce qualitatively similar stories about the relative 
level of VPIN. In both cases, it rises before the crash and stays high throughout the rest of the 
day. The trade-by-trade classification results are different. Here the estimated VPIN increases 
before the crash, although not as dramatically as it does with time bars, but it falls to unusually 
low levels immediately after the crash and it remains low for the rest of the day. This inertia, 
however, is over a period in which the market rose by more than 4%. It seems highly unlikely 
that volume was, in fact, balanced over this period. We suspect that this is more a result of trade 
misclassification than anything else, and so we do not use trade-by-trade classification. Instead, 
we report results for 1-minute time bars while noting that the relative results with 10-second time 
bars are very similar.

3.2.  Stability to Changes in the Transaction Record 
A second stability test concerns the impact that changes in the trading record have on the 
VPIN estimate. Small discrepancies in the trading record, such as missing trades, produce two 
effects. First, missing trades could alter the volume imbalance. But since we use an amount of 
volume equivalent to an entire trading session, this impact is expected to be negligible (the 
typical trade is for a few contracts, compared to the daily average of more than two million 
contracts traded on E-mini S&P 500 futures in 2010). The second effect of missing trades comes 
in the form of a shift in the VPIN trajectory. This impact can be evaluated by shifting the starting 
point of VPIN trajectories and calculating the cross-sectional standard deviations over time. 
To assess the influence of different starting times, we compute 1,000 alternative VPIN 
trajectories for the E-mini S&P 500 futures, each starting one time bar after the previous one. We 
then take those 1,000 VPIN trajectories and align them for each time bar. Because VPIN is 
computed at the completion of each bucket, and buckets are not completed simultaneously, to 
each time bar we assign the last computed VPIN. We can then estimate a cross-sectional 
standard deviation on the difference between the first trajectory and the following 999. This 
estimate is likely to be greater than the true value of the standard deviation as a result of the 
asynchronicity in the completion of buckets. 
[FIGURE 5 HERE] 
Figure 5 shows that the cross-sectional standard deviation of differences on the 1,000 
VPIN trajectories is negligible. That time series has a mean of 0.015 while VPIN’s average value 
is much greater (around 0.23). But as we argued earlier, the fact that buckets for each of the 
1,000 trajectories are not completed simultaneously means that the true cross-sectional standard 
deviation is even smaller than this 0.015 average value. The spikes in cross-sectional standard

<!-- PAGE 24 -->

24 
 
deviations that are apparent in Figure 5 coincide with spikes in VPIN values. For example, on 
May 6th 2010 the cross-sectional standard deviation was just above 0.02, on a day when VPIN 
reached a level close to 0.5. 
In conclusion, differences in the trading record due to missing transactions or alternative 
starting points do not seem to significantly impact VPIN estimates. To see this final point, 
consider two estimates of VPIN, one of 0.45, the other 0.5. This difference is well beyond what 
we see in Figure 5. Although the difference between these two VPIN estimates may seem large, 
they are not significantly different as the two VPIN estimates are at approximately the same 
point on the CDF of VPIN (0.991 compared to 0.995). 
 
4.  ESTIMATING THE VPIN METRIC ON FUTURES 
Having established the robustness of our estimation procedures for the VPIN toxicity 
metric, we now illustrate its application to two of the most actively traded futures contracts: the 
E-mini S&P 500 (trading on the CME) and the WTI crude oil future (trading on the NYMEX).   
Our sample period is January 1st 2008 to June 6th 2011, using at each point in time the expiration 
with highest daily volume, rolled forward. We use a bucket size equal to 1/50th of the average 
daily volume in our sample period (V). Parameters are estimated on a rolling window of sample 
size n = 50 (equivalent to 1-day of volume on average).  We use the entire sample period to 
determine the cumulative distribution function of the estimated parameters. Table 2 provides 
basic statistics of the VPIN metric estimates for these contracts. 
[TABLE 2 HERE] 
 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1695596


<!-- PAGE 25 -->

25 
 
A natural concern arising from our estimates of VPIN is that its AR(1) coefficients are 
very close to 1. This might suggest that VPIN has a unit root, with its consequent implications 
that VPIN is unstable and so its CDF over any sample period would not be useful in evaluating 
the likelihood of future values. Fortunately, this is not the case.  We have already shown that 
VPIN is not affected by the shifts of the starting date of our sample considered in Figure 5.   
Table 3 also shows that the CDFs of VPIN obtained by splitting our sample into a before and 
after Flash Crash (May 6, 2011) date are nearly identical. Thus, the VPIN is, in fact, highly 
stable.  The high AR(1) coefficient and the stability of VPIN occur for the same reason. Our 
VPIN measure is computed using 50 buckets. When it is updated, the first of the existing 50 
buckets is dropped and the latest one is added. This averaging makes VPIN highly auto-
correlated, but also insures that the process does not have a long memory as at each point the 
current value of VPIN cannot depend on the value that VPIN took on 51 buckets earlier.21 
[TABLE 3 HERE] 
 
4.1.  S&P 500 (CME) 
Figure 6 shows the evolution of the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract (red line, expressed 
in terms of market value) and its VPIN metric value (green line). The VPIN metric is generally 
stable, although it clearly exhibits substantial volatility. We note that the VPIN metric reached its 
highest level for this sample on May 6th 2010, the day of the flash crash.  Such high levels of the 
VPIN metric are consistent with the largest part of the order flow being one-sided for the 
equivalent of one day of transactions. As discussed in Easley, López de Prado and O’Hara 
[2011a], this excessive toxicity led some market makers to become liquidity consumers rather 
than liquidity providers as they shut down their operations.22

[FIGURE 6 HERE] 
A more recent episode of extreme toxicity occurred in the aftermath of the Japanese 
earthquake.  Although the major Tohoku earthquake and tsunami took place in the early morning 
of March 11th 2011, the S&P 500 did not experience a large move until the subsequent 
Fukushima nuclear crisis unfolded on March 14th 2011. That day the S&P 500 registered another 
extreme level of order flow toxicity. Unlike on May 6th 2010, the March 14th 2011 crash 
occurred with light volume, during the night session (from 6pm to 11pm EST). After only 
287,360 contracts had been traded, the index had lost approximately 2.5% of its value. Figure 7 
shows that CDF(VPIN) was at its 0.97 threshold as early as 3pm, illustrating that flow toxicity 
also occurs in instances of reduced trade intensity. 
[FIGURE 7 HERE] 
 
4.2.  WTI Crude Oil (NYMEX) 
Crude oil is the most heavily traded commodity, and its strategic role in the world 
economy makes it ideal for placing geopolitical and macroeconomic wagers. Energy futures are 
also a venue in which market makers face extreme volatility in order flows. As shown in Figure 
8, the highest flow toxicity reading for this contract occurred on May 6th 2010. Such behavior is 
consistent with the fact that while the problems on May 6th were not energy related, oil futures 
were affected by the contagion of liquidity and toxicity across markets. Other than the day of the 
flash crash, the next highest toxicity levels for this contract occurred on May 5th 2011. 
[FIGURE 8 HERE] 
In early May 2011, the CFTC reported the largest long speculative position among crude 
traders in history.23 The New York Times attributed these large positions to traders believing that

energy prices would ramp up, fueled by the violence sweeping through North Africa and the 
Middle East.24 Some of these traders decided to take profits on May 5th 2011.25 The unwinding 
of their massive positions led them to seek liquidity, but as market makers realized that the 
selling pressure was persistent, they started to withdraw, which in turn increased the 
concentration of toxic flow in the overall volume. Figure 9 shows that by 9:53am CDF(VPIN) 
crossed the 0.9 threshold, remaining there for the rest of the day. During those few hours, WTI 
lost over 8%.26 
[FIGURE 9 HERE] 
 
5.  TOXICITY AND FUTURE PRICE MOVEMENTS 
In a high frequency market, market makers can use the VPIN metric derived and 
estimated above to measure the toxicity of order flow. Because toxicity affects market makers’ 
profits, toxicity should also affect market maker behavior, and by extension liquidity in the 
market. In this section, we address in more detail the linkage between toxicity and future price 
movements. 
As noted earlier in the paper, time is not a particularly meaningful concept to a high 
frequency market maker. Since market makers are passive traders who must wait for the order 
flow to come to them, it is volume rather than time that is the operative metric. This same 
volume metric is also relevant for considering the future linkage of toxicity and price 
movements. A market maker needs to know how toxicity will influence price behavior while he 
or she is holding a position.27 Market makers seek to turn over their positions multiple times a 
day, but how frequently they are able to do so depends on the volume of trade. Thus, for the 
market maker, two questions are relevant. First, how does high toxicity affect price behavior

<!-- PAGE 28 -->

28 
 
over this holding period?  And, second, how does the persistence of high toxicity affect price 
behavior?  
While these questions are straightforward, answering them is not.  One difficulty is that 
standard microstructure models are not well-suited for capturing behavior in the new high 
frequency world.  We simply do not have models of multiple, competing market makers who 
face information and inventory constraints, and who manage risk by moving across and between 
(or even completely out of) markets in microseconds. Thus, theory does not provide the exact 
linkage between toxicity, liquidity, and volatility that we seek.   A second difficulty is that the 
econometrics of analyzing liquidity and volatility in such a world are embryonic, reflecting the 
many distinctive features of high frequency data  already noted throughout this paper.   
To address these questions, therefore, we draw on basic relationships to examine the 
linkages between toxicity, liquidity and volatility.  We first look at the relationship between 
toxicity and price movements defined over the subsequent volume bucket, which we argue is the 
relevant interval from the perspective of the market maker.  We then consider how the 
persistence of toxicity influences return behavior over longer intervals.  In general, we know that 
as toxicity increases, market makers face potential losses and so may opt to reduce, or even 
abandon market making activities. This decrease in liquidity, in turn, suggests that high levels of 
VPIN should presage greater price variability.28  
 
5.1.  Correlation Surface 
We begin by asking a simple question:  Is the VPIN volatility metric correlated with 
future price movements?  To measure this relationship, we use Pearson’s correlation between the 
natural logarithm of VPIN and the absolute price return over the following bucket, 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1695596


<!-- PAGE 29 -->

29 
 
                 
        , where τ indexes volume buckets. Because VPINs can be estimated 
using various combinations of the number of volume buckets per day and the sample length, we 
examine how these estimation parameters affect the VPIN metric’s relationship with future price 
movements. 
For E-mini S&P 500 futures, VPINs are positively correlated with future price volatility.  
This relationship is demonstrated in Figure 10 where each point on the graph was computed 
using large samples, some of over 44,000 observations. The figure shows that the correlation 
between VPIN and the following absolute future returns varies smoothly across different 
parameter values.   In general, increasing the sample length increases the correlation as does, to a 
lesser degree, increasing the numbers of buckets per day. 
[FIGURE 10 HERE] 
The (50,250) combination seems a reasonably good pair for E-mini S&P 500, and it has a 
simple interpretation as “one week” of data (50 volume buckets per day and 5 trading days per 
week). For this combination, we obtain a correlation                  
             on 44537 
observations.29 Figure 10 suggests that there is little advantage in “over-fitting” these parameters, 
as there is a wide region of parameter combinations yielding similar predictive power.30  
[FIGURE 11 HERE] 
Figure 11 provides a plot of the return on the E-mini S&P 500 futures over the next 
volume bucket (1/50 of an average day’s volume using the (50,250) combination) sorted by the 
previous VPIN level. The graph spreads out vertically as VPIN rises, illustrating that higher 
toxicity levels, as measured by higher VPIN, lead to greater absolute returns.  
These findings in terms of correlation are suggestive, but simple correlation is a narrow 
criterion of dependency. In fact, VPIN exhibits significant serial correlation, which makes

drawing conclusions from a simple correlation problematic. One alternative would be to estimate 
a time series model of the joint VPIN-returns process. We do not pursue this approach here as 
our hypothesis is not that high VPIN levels lead to high absolute returns in a particular time 
period. Instead, our hypothesis is that persistently high VPIN levels have implications for market 
maker behavior, which in turn have implications for absolute returns measured using a volume 
clock. To shed light on this hypothesis, we employ a model-free framework based on conditional 
probabilities. We then ask two fundamental questions: (1) When VPIN is high, what is the 
subsequent behavior of absolute returns? (2) When absolute returns are high, what was the 
preceding level of VPIN?  
 
5.2.  Conditional Probabilities 
To display these conditional probabilities we need to compute the joint distribution of 
VPIN and absolute returns. We do this by first grouping VPINs in 5%-tiles and absolute returns 
in bins of size 0.25% so that we can display discrete distributions. We then compute the joint 
distribution of             
        . From this joint distribution we derive two conditional 
probability distributions.  
We first examine the distribution of absolute returns over the subsequent volume bucket 
conditional on VPIN being in each of our twenty 5%-tile bins. This results in twenty conditional 
distributions, one for each VPIN-bin, which are displayed in Table 4a. Each row of this table 
represents a conditional distribution of absolute returns, conditioned on the prior level of VPIN.  
[TABLE 4(a), 4(b) HERE] 
There are three important results to note.  First, when VPIN is low, subsequent absolute 
returns are also low.  In particular, when VPIN is in its bottom quartile, subsequent absolute

<!-- PAGE 31 -->

31 
 
returns are in the 0% to 0.25% range more than 90% of time.. Second, when VPIN is high, the 
conditional distribution of subsequent returns is much more dispersed.  In particular, high 
absolute returns (above 1.5%) sometimes occur during the subsequent volume bucket, while they 
never occur following very low VPINs. Third, even for high levels of VPIN, absolute returns 
over the next volume bucket are most often not large. We elaborate on this point in the next 
subsection where we argue that it takes persistently high levels of VPIN to reliably generate 
large absolute returns.  
Next, in Table 4b we examine the distribution of VPIN in bucket τ-1 conditional on 
absolute returns between buckets τ-1 and τ. Each column of this table provides the distribution 
of prior VPINs conditional on absolute returns in each bin of size 0.25%. The important result 
here is that when absolute returns are large the immediately preceding VPIN was rarely small. In 
particular, the upper quartile of this distribution contains over 84% of all absolute returns greater 
than 0.75%. This fact suggests that VPIN has some insurance value against extreme price 
volatility.To compute these conditional probabilities, we used our standard (50,250) parameter 
combination. This choice of parameters maximized the correlation between VPIN and absolute 
returns, but it does not necessarily maximize a particular “risk scenario”, say for example, 
                  
 
     
               . The following figure shows the effect of 
parameter choices on VPIN’s insurance value against absolute returns greater than 0.75%. 
[FIGURE 12 HERE] 
Figure 12 shows that as long as the number of buckets per day is not extremely large, and 
the sample length is not extremely small, the probability that VPIN was in the upper quartile one 
volume bucket prior to a 0.75% or greater absolute return will be between 80% and 90%. This

32 
 
result not only means that VPIN anticipates a large proportion of extreme volatility events, but 
also that toxicity-induced volatility seems to be a significant source of overall volatility. 
 
5.3.  Is Extreme Volatility Always Preceded by High VPIN? 
Table 4a shows that for the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract, large absolute returns, 
greater than say 2%, are very unlikely if the preceding VPIN was low. But they are possible and 
searching across contracts certainly provides examples in which they occur. A recent example of 
extreme price volatility in the natural gas futures vividly illustrates this possibility. According to 
The Financial Times31, on June 8th 2011: “The New York Mercantile Exchange floor had been 
closed for more than five hours when late on Wednesday Nymex July natural gas dropped 39 
cents, or 8.1 per cent, to $4.510 per million British thermal units. After a few seconds, it bounced 
back up”. An explanation was offered in The Financial Times on June 9th 2011: “Some market 
watchers attributed the decline to a ‘fat finger’ error, when a trader mistakenly types an extra 
zero on the end of an order, increasing its size by a factor of 10. Others blamed it on a glitch in 
computer algorithms that trade futures. Volume was light, meaning any big order would have 
had an outsize impact and potentially triggered automated selling”.  
If the FT’s explanation is correct, then VPIN should not have been high before the price 
decline. Figure 13 shows that this is what occurred. There was a sudden decline in prices 
followed by an immediate recovery, all of which occurred at relatively low toxicity levels. This 
example illustrates two useful points:  Not all volatility is due to toxicity; and, it may be helpful 
to regulators to know when a price drop is due to toxicity or arises from other potential causes.

5.4.  Does Extreme Volatility Always Occur Once VPIN is High?  
 
We know from Table 4b that large absolute returns do not necessarily occur in the next 
volume bucket when VPIN is large. In fact, most of the absolute returns immediately following a 
high VPIN observation are not large. This observation, however, is consistent with our 
hypothesis that persistently high levels of VPIN lead to volatility. To examine our hypothesis, we 
need to quantify the maximum amount of volatility that a market maker is exposed to once VPIN 
reaches some critical level and stays at or above that critical level. The flash crash provides a 
stark illustration of why the distinction between immediate volatility and ensuing volatility is 
important. During the flash crash, VPIN remained high from before the crash began until well 
after it ended and prices began their partial recovery. If we focus on the time period beginning 
when VPIN reached some high level and ending when it fell, there is only a small price decline. 
This fact would be of little comfort to the many market makers who left the market during the 
crash. They were affected by the large intermediate volatility that occurred while VPIN was 
high. 
To examine the maximum intermediate volatility experienced by a market maker while 
VPIN is high, we compute volatility events while VPIN remains within any 5%-tile. In 
particular, every time VPIN moves from one 5%-tile to another, we compute the largest absolute 
return that occurs between any two intermediate (not necessarily consecutive) buckets, until 
VPIN moves to another 5%-tile. For example, suppose that the VPIN metric moves into the 85th 
percentile and 4 volume buckets later it moves to the 90th percentile. We would calculate the 
absolute return between buckets 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, as well as between 2 and 3, 2 and 4, 
and 3 and 4. We are interested in the maximum of these absolute returns, which we view as the 
maximum volatility the market maker faces. We do this for every such VPIN crossing.

To be precise, we let i be an index that is updated by one every time that VPIN crosses 
from one percentile into another, and      the bucket associated with the ith cross. This means 
that VPIN remained in the same percentile for             buckets; in our example above 
this was the 4 bucket interval over which VPIN remained in the 85th percentile. The largest 
absolute return between any two intermediate buckets while VPIN remained in a particular 
percentile (i.e., from the bucket at which it made the ith crossing until it made the i+1th crossing) 
is then 
   
        
             
   
  
    
(10) 
 
In our example above this is the maximum of the six intermediate returns over the interval in 
which VPIN remained in the 85th percentile.  
This analysis is richer than the conditional probabilities illustrated in Table 4a in two 
respects. First, we are not just considering the absolute return that occurs in the bucket 
immediately following VPIN’s crossing into a bin, but rather the maximum absolute return that 
occurs while VPIN remains in a bin. This is consistent with our microstructure theory that 
volatility appears once toxicity has reached a saturation point that exceeds market makers’ 
tolerance. Second, it captures price volatility across all sequences of intermediate buckets, thus 
incorporating the effect of price drifts as well as price recoveries. This is important, because slow 
price drifts and price recoveries may both hide extreme volatility. But this analysis is also limited 
in that it does not capture sustained increases in toxicity spanning multiple VPIN percentiles.  In 
particular, we do not capture what happens when toxicity increases from the 75th to the 80th and 
then on to the 85th, 90th, etc.  Thus, the hurdle we set here will surely underestimate the effect of 
toxicity-induced volatility.

[FIGURE 14 HERE] 
Figure 14 plots the probabilities of the largest absolute return being in excess of 0.75% 
while VPIN remains in any 5%-tile in the upper quartile of its distribution (i.e. VPIN is in the 
0.75-0.80, 0.80-0.85, 0.85-0.90, 0.90-0.95, or 0.95-1.00 bin) for various combinations of buckets 
per day and sample length. For our standard combination of (50,250), we find that 51.84% of the 
times that VPIN enters a 5%-tile within the upper quartile there is at least one intermediate return 
in excess of 0.75% before VPIN leaves that 5%-tile. The parameter combination that maximizes 
VPIN’s predictive power is (10,350), i.e. 10 buckets per day for a sample length of 350 (about 
1.6 months). For this parameter combination, Table 5 shows that 78.57% of the times that VPIN 
enters a 5%-tile within the upper quartile of its distribution, toxicity-induced volatility often will 
be substantial (absolute returns in excess of 0.75%) before VPIN leaves that 5%-tile.

6.  CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents a new procedure to estimate the Volume-Synchronized Probability of 
Informed Trading, or the VPIN flow toxicity metric. An important advantage of the VPIN 
toxicity metric and its associated estimation procedure is that it is updated intraday with a 
frequency attuned to volume in order to match the speed of information arrival. It is also a direct 
analytic estimation procedure that does not rely on intermediate estimation of unobservable 
parameters, or numerical methods. We have shown that the VPIN metric has significant 
forecasting power over toxicity-induced volatility, and that it offers insurance value against 
future high absolute returns.

It is this latter property that we believe makes VPIN a risk management tool for the new 
world of high frequency trading. Liquidity provision is now a complex process, and levels of 
toxicity affect both the scale and scope of market makers’ activities. High levels of VPIN signify 
a high risk of subsequent large price movements, deriving from the effects of toxicity on 
liquidity provision. This liquidity-based risk is important for market makers who directly bear 
the effects of toxicity, but it is also significant for traders who face the prospect of toxicity-
induced large price movements.32 Developing algorithms that would vary the execution pattern 
of orders depending upon toxicity would allow traders to mitigate this risk.33 Exchanges could 
also apply VPIN to provision machine resources in a way that speeds up trading on the side with 
greater liquidity while slowing down trading on the side under attack (a sort of dynamic circuit-
breaker), thus allowing market makers to remain active. We believe this is an important area for 
future research.

liquidity in equity markets. 
5 The literature has more complex models of the arrival process, but to illustrate our ideas we 
stay with the simplest model. The simple model has an advantage over more complex models in 
that it yields a simple expression for the probability of information-based trade which is easy to 
compute. In spite of its simplicity and its obvious abstraction from the reality of the trading 
process, this expression has proven useful in a variety of settings. 
6 Mandelbrot and Taylor [1967] noted that this was true of equity trading even in the 1960s. 
7 A variety of authors have further developed this notion of time as an important characteristic of 
trading. Of particular importance, Engle [1996] and Engle and Russell [2005] develop the role of 
time in a new class of autoregressive-conditional duration (ACD) models. 
8 Publically available data generally do not distinguish buys and sells, so an algorithm is 
necessary to infer buys and sells. The algorithm we use seems to work well, but the algorithm 
itself is independent of the VPIN metric. Any algorithm (or even better data about buys and 
sells) could be used to provide input to the estimation of VPIN. 
9 Informed and uninformed trading in an electronic limit order market has been examined by 
numerous authors, for example Bloomfield, O’Hara and Saar [2005], and Foucault, Kadan and 
Kandel [2009].

10 Over the last three years of E-mini S&P 500 futures data, in an average 10-minute period there 
were 2,200 trades encompassing 21,000 contracts traded. 
11 We thank Mark Ready for helpful advice on trade classification in high frequency markets. 
12 We focus on time bars because data vendors (such as Bloomberg) provide such information 
and so it is a more familiar concept to market practitioners. However, both conventions (Time 
and Volume bars) have their own merits, and we hope to investigate these alternatives further in 
future work.  
13 Readers familiar with unsupervised machine learning techniques will not be surprised with the 
logic behind our bulk classification procedure. 
14 This assumption may of course not reflect the empirical characteristics of the data, but we are 
at this point simply discussing the properties of     as they relate to bulk classification.  
15 As the average number of time bars per bucket increases from 1 to 30, order imbalance as a 
fraction of bucket size decreases from 0.52 to 0.25, with standard deviations ranging from 0.33 
to 0.22. 
16 This is hardly a surprising result as it corresponds to the principle that bulk counting can be 
more useful than item counting under measurement error. 
17 This metric uses an approximation because the arrival rate of information-based trades is 
approximated by the expected order imbalance. A more accurate estimator is presented in 
Appendix A.1.3. However, Appendix A.2 shows through Monte Carlo simulations that this 
simpler expression produces an acceptable estimation error. 
18 At a daily level the relationship between volume and price change (which is a proxy for 
information arrival) has been explored by many authors including Clark [1973], Tauchen and 
Pitts [1983], Harris [1986], and Easley and O’Hara [1992].

19 For predicting toxicity-induced volatility what matters is whether the level of VPIN at any 
time is unusual relative to its distribution for the asset in question. The actual level of VPIN, 
which is sensitive to the choice of bucket size, sample length, trade classification, and so on, is 
not our primary concern. Of course, if making different choices of these parameters does more 
than rescale VPIN it could affect relative VPINs. The results in this section and those in later 
estimations strongly suggest that this is not the case. 
20 For the 1-minute and 10-second time bars VPIN continues to increase during the flash crash 
and it remains high for the remainder of the flash crash day. Thus, according to our 
interpretation, order flow was highly toxic throughout the flash crash and it remained toxic 
during the price recovery following the crash. This is consistent with the very high price 
volatility observed during and after the crash---prices first fell and then rose. VPIN is not a 
directional indicator; it only indicates toxicity-induced volatility without predicting the sign of 
the price changes.  
21 There are, however, two means by which dependence can enter into VPIN. First, the exact 
timing of buckets does depend on the entire sample. Our results on variations in the starting date 
of the sample show that this timing issue is not important over our fairly long sample. Second, 
VPIN is based on order imbalance which is auto-correlated. But the auto-correlation of order 
imbalance for the E-mini S&P 500 contract over our sample is only 0.2146.

27 Of course, market makers affect prices through their own trading. Our analysis best applies to 
markets in which there are many participants, which is clearly the case for the E-mini S&P 500 
futures contract. 
28 Deuskar and Johnson [2011] also look at the effects of order imbalance (which they term flow-
driven risk) on market returns and volatility.  Their analysis uses chronological time and so it is 
not directly comparable to what we do here. They find significant flow-driven effects on returns 
but note that their measure does not appear to be consistent with measuring the degree of 
asymmetric information.  We believe this dimension is better captured by our volume-based 
analysis which incorporates the arrival of new information.  However, both their model and ours 
provide strong evidence that order imbalance has important implications for market liquidity.  
29 Statisticians often prefer to look at correlation using the Fisher transform, which for our 
analysis is given by                     , and 95% confidence bands given by 
                 
                        More details regarding the statistical properties of 
correlation coefficients  can be found in Fisher (1915).

Fundamental Law of Active Management,         , where IR represents the Information 
Ratio, IC the Information Coefficient (correlation between forecasts and realizations), and BR 
the breadth (independent bets per year). Although a correlation of 40% may seem relatively 
small, the breadth of high frequency models is large, allowing these algorithms to achieve high 
Information Ratios. For example, an IR of 2 can be reached through a monthly model with IC of

models produce more than one independent bet per day, thus a correlation of over 0.4 is very 
significant.  
31 Reported by Gregory Meyer at the Financial Times of June 9th 2011. 
32 We stress that, in our view, VPIN is not a substitute for VIX, but rather a complementary 
metric for addressing a different risk.  VIX captures the markets’ expectation of future volatility, 
and hence is useful for hedging the effects of risk on a portfolio’s return.  VPIN captures the 
level of toxicity affecting liquidity provision, which in turn affects future short-run volatility 
when this toxicity becomes unusually high.  For more discussion, see Easley, López de Prado 
and O’Hara [2011b].  
33 The Waddell and Reed trader who submitted a large sell order in S&P 500 futures 
precipitating the flash crash would surely have been well advised to avoid trading in a market 
that was exhibiting record high levels of toxicity.

APPENDICES 
 
A.1. ALGORITHM FOR COMPUTING THE VPIN METRIC1 
In this appendix, we describe the procedure to calculate Volume-Synchronized Probability of 
Informed Trading, a measure we called the VPIN flow toxicity metric. Similar results can be 
reached with more computationally efficient algorithms, such as re-using data from previous 
iterations, performing fewer steps or in a different order, etc.  The algorithm described below is 
illustrative of the general idea.  
 
One feature of this algorithm is that we apply a probabilistic approach to classify the volume 
exchanged within each 1-minute time bars. We cannot expect users to have data which 
unequivocally identifies trades as buyer-initiated or seller-initiated so some classification 
procedure is necessary. One could classify each trade separately or one could classify trades in 
aggregates of an alternative size (based on either time, number of trades or volume bars). 
Different schemes will lead to different levels of VPIN. We have used a variety of schemes and 
conclude that data aggregation leads to better flow toxicity estimates than working on raw 
transaction data. Data granularity has an impact on the magnitude of VPIN levels, however our 
focus is on how rare a particular VPIN is relative to the distribution of VPINs derived from any 
classification scheme, and this is unaffected by the classification schemes we have examined 
(including trade-by-trade as well as groups based on one-tenth of a bucket). We focus on 1-
minute time bars as this data is less noisy, more widely available and easier to work with.

Table A1 – Monte Carlo results for n=50 
 
We generate nodes of 
 scanning the entire range of possible parameters, 
 and 
, with V=100, and n=50 (where n is the number of volume buckets used to approximate 
the expected trade imbalance and intensity). The arrival rate of uninformed trade ε is then 
determined at each node, using the aforementioned expression. Ten equidistant partitions are 
investigated per dimension (112 nodes), carrying out 100,000 simulations of flow arrival per 
node (112 x 105 simulations in total). This yields a Monte Carlo accuracy of the order of 10-4. 
 
The Table shows that there is a negligible bias, on the order of 10-3, towards underestimating the 
true value of the VPIN metric. These results motivate our use of n=50 in our estimation of 
VPIN. 
 
Next, we present the Monte Carlo algorithm that we use to simulate order flow based on known 
parameters (α,μ,ε).2 The VPIN metric can be estimated on that simulated order flow, and 
compared with the PIN values derived from the actual parameter values, (α,μ,ε).

TABLES 
Table 1:  Results of sampling by Chronological time versus Volume time 
 
 
 
We use data from 1-minute time bars from the E-mini S&P futures contract from January 1, 2008-August 
1, 2011. We draw an average of 50 (left panel) and 100 (right panel) price observations a day in two 
samples, one equally spaced in time (denoted chrono time) and the other equally spaced in volume 
(denoted volume time).  We compute first differences in mean returns and standardize each sample.  The 
table gives the resulting statistical properties, where

Figure 3: Graphs of Price Changes for E-mini S&P 500 futures, sampled by regular time 
intervals and regular volume intervals 
 
This figure shows the distribution of normalized price changes for the E-Mini S&P futures 
contract.  Our sample period is January 1, 2008 – August 1, 2011.  We draw an average of 50 
price observations per day equally spaced in time for the time clock and equally spaced by 
volume for the volume clock.  We compute first order differences and standardize each sample.  
The black line gives the normal distribution.
